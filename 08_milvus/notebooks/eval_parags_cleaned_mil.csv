2159#5#Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) ,"There is no single test that can diagnose premenstrual syndrome (PMS) or premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). The symptoms must occur only during the second half (luteal phase) of the menstrual cycle, most often during the five to seven days before the menstrual period, and there must be physical as well as behavioral symptoms. In women with PMS or PMDD, these symptoms should not be present between days 4 through 12 of a 28-day menstrual cycle."
3421#13#Syncope (fainting) ,Less common causes of syncope include cardiac tumor or blood clot in the arteries supplying the lungs.
2724#15#Sunburn prevention ,"As people become more aware of the risks of skin cancer from sun exposure and tanning beds, sunless tanning products have become increasingly popular. A variety of safe and natural-appearing sunless tanning products are available, including lotions, gels, and sprays.Topical tanning agents, such as dihydroxyacetone, combine with proteins in the skin, making it darker. The staining is temporary, usually lasting less than one week unless you reapply the product, but does not provide any protection from sunburn. "
6735#13#Gestational diabetes ,"You may need tests to monitor the health of the baby during the later stages of pregnancy, especially if your blood sugars have been high, you are using insulin, or if you have any pregnancy-related complications (eg, high blood pressure). The most commonly used test is the nonstress test. This test is discussed in a separate topic review. (See  ""Patient education: Postterm pregnancy (Beyond the Basics)"".)"
4428#4#Diabetic kidney disease ,"Urine tests are recommended once per year in people with type 1 diabetes, beginning about five years after diagnosis, and in people with type 2 diabetes, starting at the time of diagnosis.The urine test is looking for a protein called albumin. If there is a very large amount of albumin (protein) in your urine, it means you have diabetic kidney disease. You may be told that you have ""microalbuminuria"" or ""high albuminuria"". That simply means that you have trace amounts of protein in your urine, but it still means that you are at risk for getting diabetic kidney disease, assuming you do not have kidney disease caused by another condition. (See  ""Patient education: Protein in the urine (proteinuria) (Beyond the Basics)"".)The same urine test that is used to diagnose diabetic kidney disease will also be used to monitor your condition over time. (See 'Ongoing monitoring' below.)"
7637#3#Contact dermatitis (including latex dermatitis) ,"The most common causes of irritant dermatitis are products used on a daily basis, including soap, cleansers, and rubbing alcohol. People with other skin conditions, such as atopic dermatitis (eczema) or dry skin, are at greatest risk, although anyone can develop irritant dermatitis."
1200#19#Chronic abdominal pain in children and adolescents ,"Carbohydrate malabsorption from fermentable sugars can lead to abdominal pain and bloating. Food products high in fermentable sugars can trigger irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Examples include corn syrup, certain fruits (eg, apples, grapes, watermelon) and vegetables (eg, peas, asparagus, zucchini), and natural sweeteners (eg, honey, agave, maple syrup, molasses). Although elimination of these sugars may be helpful for children with chronic abdominal pain, it should be discussed with your child's doctor or nurse. Because these sugars are found in so many foods, their elimination should be planned with and monitored by a pediatric dietician."
1999#14#Celiac disease in adults ,Cancer of the intestinal lymph system (lymphoma) is an uncommon complication of celiac disease. Avoiding gluten can usually prevent this complication.
1216#36#Vaccines for infants and children age 0 to 6 years ,"The hepatitis A (HepA) vaccine is recommended for all children between 12 and 23 months of age. Catch-up immunization is recommended for children between 2 and 18 years of age. In all age groups, two doses are required, given at least six months apart.The vaccine also is recommended for certain high-risk adults, such as international travelers, people with blood clotting disorders or chronic liver disease, homeless individuals, and those who live in communities with a high hepatitis A infection rate.For babies 6 to 11 months who are traveling internationally, vaccination should be administered; the travel-related dose should not be counted toward the routine two-dose series."
8409#8#Genital warts in women ,"Podofilox is similar to podophyllin, but you can apply podofilox (Condylox) at home. Using a cotton swab, you apply a gel or liquid solution to the wart(s) twice daily for three days in a row. Then you use no treatment for the next four days. You can repeat this cycle up to four times until the warts have gone away. Podofilox is not used in pregnant women. Side effects of podofilox are similar to those of podophyllin."
4006#9#Genital herpes ,"Illness, stress, sunlight, and fatigue can trigger recurrent herpes outbreaks. In women, menstrual periods may trigger an outbreak."
3433#6#High cholesterol and lipid treatment options ,"People with diabetes (type 1 or 2) are at high risk of heart disease. A moderate- or high-intensity statin is recommended in most adults with diabetes, regardless of their baseline LDL cholesterol level. (See  ""Patient education: Type 2 diabetes: Overview (Beyond the Basics)"".)"
700#10#Total hip replacement ,"Serious complications after hip replacement surgery are not common and can be minimized by choosing a surgeon who is experienced and performs the procedure frequently. In addition, choosing a hospital that specializes in caring for joint replacement patients before, during, and after surgery can also minimize complications.Complications can occur during surgery, in the immediate postoperative period, or many years after surgery. It is important to understand these potential risks before deciding to undergo hip replacement. For most people, the benefits of reduced pain and improved function outweigh the small risk of complications.The following are some of the complications that can occur during or after hip replacement surgery."
6722#13#Care during pregnancy for women with type 1 or 2 diabetes ,"Ultrasound is also used to monitor the amount of amniotic fluid around the fetus; polyhydramnios is an abnormal increase in the amount of amniotic fluid. Polyhydramnios is more common in women with diabetes than in women without diabetes. Polyhydramnios related to diabetes is usually mild and does not cause problems. If the fluid levels become severely elevated, maternal discomfort, uterine contractions, prelabor rupture of the membranes (""breaking the water""), and preterm delivery can occur. (See  ""Patient education: Preterm labor (Beyond the Basics)"".)"
684#5#Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in adults ,"The primary goals of treatment are to relieve symptoms, help you live as long as possible, and prevent your CML from progressing to the blast phase. Achieving these goals generally requires markedly reducing the number of cells that contain the abnormal ""Philadelphia chromosome"" and enabling the return of normal (non-leukemic) blood cells.There are several ways to measure how well your treatment is working, using various blood tests:The hematologic response refers to the disappearance of CML cells from the blood and a return to normal blood cell counts.The cytogenetic response refers to the disappearance of cells that contain the Philadelphia chromosome from the blood or bone marrow. Measurement of the cytogenetic response can detect as few as one CML cell among 100 normal blood or bone marrow cells.The molecular response indicates whether the abnormal BCR-ABL1 gene is present, using a sensitive molecular test called RT-PCR (reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction). PCR can detect as few as one BCR-ABL1-positive CML cell among 10,000 to 100,000 normal cells.A hematologic response is typically associated with a decrease in the severity of symptoms but, alone, it does not ensure that CML is adequately controlled. Unless a cytogenetic response is achieved, there is a continued risk of progression to accelerated phase or blast phase of CML.The term ""complete molecular response"" has been used to describe cases in which the BCR-ABL1 gene is no longer detectable, but various PCR tests have different sensitivities (ie, differences in their ability to detect very small numbers of CML cells). Although a complete molecular response reflects disappearance of all detectable CML cells, it does not ensure cure of the disease."
682#13#Blood donation and transfusion ,"Hepatitis is a viral infection that causes inflammation of the liver. Blood donors are routinely screened to determine whether they have been exposed to (or infected with) the hepatitis B virus or the hepatitis C virus.People who have had sexual contact or have lived in the same dwelling (eg, house, dormitory) with someone who has hepatitis B or hepatitis C are disqualified for 12 months after their last exposure to that person, depending upon the particulars of the exposure. A similar deferral is applied in the case of exposure to people with viral hepatitis of unknown origin.People who have ever had a confirmed positive test for hepatitis B surface antigen (a marker for hepatitis B virus infection) are permanently disqualified from donating blood. Hepatitis B vaccination may temporarily cause this test to become positive [2]. In order to avoid being disqualified as a blood donor, a person who has recently received the hepatitis B vaccine should wait 21 days before donating blood. At that time, this test should be negative. Donors with false positive or vaccine-induced positive hepatitis B surface antigen results can be requalified to donate if the blood center follows a stringent protocol and a sufficient amount of time has elapsed.Donors are not asked if they have ever had viral hepatitis. However, if a person volunteers the information that they previously had hepatitis B or C, most blood centers will defer such donors, since a positive laboratory test would require the donated blood to be destroyed.In the event that a community is experiencing an ongoing outbreak of hepatitis A, temporary deferral procedures for exposure to this agent could be put in place.People who have received a blood transfusion are not permitted to donate blood for 12 months after the date of transfusion.In some states, people who have received a tattoo are not permitted to donate blood for 12 months. In many other states, where the tattooing industry is carefully regulated by state law to ensure that the procedures are sterile, donation may be permitted without the need for any waiting period. With regard to ear or body piercing, donation is allowed if the procedure was performed with sterile or single-use equipment."
3438#6#Raynaud phenomenon ,"Most often, a Raynaud attack affects the blood vessels in the fingers. In a typical attack, the fingers (or toes) become suddenly cold as the blood vessels constrict. The skin color changes markedly and may become pale (called a ""white attack"") or a purple or blue color (called a ""blue attack"") (picture 1). Usually, an attack of RP begins in a single finger and then spreads to other fingers in both hands. The color changes often affect the whole finger from tip to base. The index, middle, and ring fingers are most commonly involved, while the thumb is often not affected.An attack can cause discomfort, including a ""pins and needles"" feeling, aching, numbness, or clumsiness of the affected hand(s). The feeling of true pain occurs more often in secondary RP and is caused by a prolonged loss of blood flow to the tissues.Blood vessels supplying the skin of the ears, nose, face, knees, and nipples can also be affected, and the skin in these areas may become pale or bluish in color after cold exposure. Rarely, the tongue can be involved. Temporary mottling (a bluish discoloration) of the skin of the arms and legs might also appear. Attacks affecting the toes are also common, although people tend to complain of these less frequently.Symptoms of RP resolve as the provoking factor (cold or stress) is removed. After leaving the cold area and rewarming, the discoloration resolves after 15 to 20 minutes, and, as normal blood flow resumes, the skin ""blushes"" or becomes pink. During the recovery phase, the person may experience mild discomfort.People with severe secondary Raynaud phenomenon (RP) can sometimes experience a serious decrease in blood flow that does not resolve even after the provoking factor or cold is removed. This is due to underlying damage to the blood vessels or irreversible structural changes such as a blockage in the vessel that obstructs blood flow. Pain and ulceration of the skin (usually on the tips of the fingers and toes) can result. In severe cases, deeper tissue injury can occur that can lead to loss of the tips of the fingers in some people with a secondary vascular disease that causes RP."
2179#23#Hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid) ,"Hypothyroidism can increase the risk of certain surgery-related complications; bowel function may be slow to recover, and infection may be overlooked if there is no fever. If preoperative blood tests reveal low thyroid hormone levels, nonemergency surgery is usually postponed until treatment has returned T4 levels to normal."
375#1#Trigger avoidance in allergic rhinitis ,"Allergic rhinitis, also known as hay fever, affects approximately 20 percent of people of all ages. The most common symptoms include nasal itching, watery nasal discharge, sneezing, itchy red eyes, sore throat, or hoarse voice.Allergic rhinitis is caused by a nasal reaction to small airborne particles called allergens (substances that cause an allergic reaction). In some people, these particles also cause reactions in the lungs (asthma) and eyes (allergic conjunctivitis).One of the first steps in treating any allergic condition is to avoid or minimize exposure to the allergens that cause the condition [1]. Although this is frequently helpful in reducing symptoms, there may be a tradeoff between avoidance and quality of life. Where avoidance is inadequate to control symptoms, clinicians have many tools to treat allergies. Allergen avoidance should never be so severe as to isolate individuals from social interactions.The evaluation and treatment of allergic rhinitis is discussed in a separate topic review. (See  ""Patient education: Allergic rhinitis (Beyond the Basics)"".)"
1215#19#Constipation in infants and children ,"If your infant or child has repeated episodes of constipation (called recurrent constipation), work with your child's doctor or nurse to figure out why this is happening. Some children with chronic and recurrent constipation can develop a problem with bowel leakage (called fecal incontinence), in which liquid stool leaks around the large hard stool in the rectum. Because the leaking stool is soft, some parents can confuse this with diarrhea.Possible reasons for recurrent constipation include:Fear of pain due to hard stools or an anal fissure (a small tear in the anal opening). A child can withhold stool by willfully clinching his or her buttocks (butt cheeks), which can be confused with the child trying to push the stool out. Discussing this with your doctor can help you learn to tell whether your child is trying to withhold stool.Fear of using the bathroom away from home.Not having enough time to use the bathroom.Reducing the laxative dose or discontinuing laxative too soon."
712#11#Knee pain ,"To speed recovery and protect against future knee damage, activities that cause pain should be avoided temporarily.If the knee is swollen or sore, the following positions and activities should be avoided until knee pain and swelling resolve:SquattingKneelingTwisting and pivotingJoggingAerobics, dancingPlaying sportsSwimming using the frog or whip kickThe following types of exercise equipment should be avoided if the knee is swollen or sore, unless specifically prescribed by a physical therapist or physician:Stair stepperRowing machineSquatsLeg extensionsThe preferred exercise equipment for the knee should provide smooth motion of the knee, strengthening of the front and back thigh muscles (quadriceps and hamstring muscles), minimal jarring and impact to the joint, and the least amount of bending necessary. These activities are acceptable alternatives to those listed above:Fast walkingWater aerobicsSwimming using the crawl strokeCross country ski or elliptical-type machinesSoft platform treadmill"
2178#6#Hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid) ,"Hyperthyroidism can be diagnosed with blood tests that measure the amount of thyroid hormone and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). Typically, the thyroid hormone level is high, and the TSH level is low. A thyroid scan or a blood test may also be recommended to help determine the cause of hyperthyroidism (Graves' disease, toxic nodular goiter, or thyroiditis)."
1184#11#High blood pressure treatment in children ,"Energy drinks have a high content of sugar and/or caffeine or other stimulants and can aggravate weight, heart rhythm, and blood pressure problems, and should be avoided."
7634#6#Acne ,"Psychological stress can probably worsen acne. In several studies of students, acne severity appeared to worsen during times of increased stress."
6722#8#Care during pregnancy for women with type 1 or 2 diabetes ,"Pregnancy-related hypertension (preeclampsia, gestational hypertension) is more common in women with diabetes. Fortunately, most cases are mild. In severe cases, seizure, stroke, heart failure, kidney damage, and, rarely, maternal death can occur. (See  ""Patient education: Preeclampsia (Beyond the Basics)"".)Women with preexisting diabetes are asked to take low dose aspirin (81 mg) daily, starting at the beginning of the second trimester (by 16 weeks of gestation) to decrease the chance of developing preeclampsia. "
1188#5#Mouth and dental injuries in children ,"Depending upon the injury, children will often need an imaging test (x-ray, computed tomography [CT] scan, magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]). The imaging test can help to determine if there are fractures in a bone, damage to the root of a tooth, damage to a blood vessel, or if the child has swallowed or inhaled a foreign body (ie, a piece of a tooth). Not every child with a dental or mouth injury will require an imaging test."
1210#2#Symptoms and diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children ,"The cause(s) of ADHD are not clear, although there are a number of theories. Most experts agree that ADHD is a medical or neurodevelopmental disorder. Many experts believe there is an inherited imbalance of chemicals in the brain. This is supported by the improvements often seen with the use of medications that affect these chemicals.Exposure to tobacco before birth may increase the risk of developing ADHD. Most experts do not feel that dietary factors (food additives, sugar, food sensitivity, mineral deficiency) cause ADHD. It is possible that some children have mild changes in behavior and attention in response to certain foods or food additives. However, these changes do not meet the diagnostic criteria for ADHD. (See 'Diagnostic criteria' below.)"
1177#11#Fever in children ,"The most effective way to treat fever is to use a medication such as acetaminophen (sample brand name: Tylenol) or ibuprofen (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin). These treatments can reduce the child's discomfort and lower the child's temperature by 2 to 3°F (1 to 1.5°C). Aspirin is not recommended for children under age 18 years due to concerns that it can cause a rare but serious illness known as Reye syndrome.Acetaminophen may be given every four to six hours as needed but should not be given more than five times in a 24-hour period. Acetaminophen should not be used in children younger than three months of age without consultation with a health care provider. The dose of acetaminophen should be calculated based upon the child's weight (not age).Ibuprofen may be given every six hours. Ibuprofen should not be used in children younger than six months of age. The dose of ibuprofen should be calculated based upon the child's weight (not age).Giving combinations of acetaminophen and ibuprofen or alternating acetaminophen and ibuprofen increases the chance of giving the wrong dose of one or the other of the medications and is not recommended routinely.Fever-reducing medications should only be given as needed and discontinued once bothersome symptoms have resolved."
689#12#Warfarin ,"There is a tendency to bleed more easily than usual while taking warfarin. Some simple measures can decrease this risk. Examples of common sense precautions include:Always use a seatbelt.Wear a helmet when riding a bicycle or motorcycle.Avoid using non-prescription medicines that contain a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (""NSAID"") as well as other over-the-counter remedies without discussing with your healthcare provider. (See 'Warfarin and medications' below.)When seeing any healthcare provider (doctor, dentist, nurse), tell them you are taking warfarin.Keep in mind that any injury you get could bleed more than normal. This includes everything from small cuts to the skin (such as nicks from a razor) to more serious injuries. To lower your risk, you can take extra care when doing things that could cause bleeding. This might include shaving with an electric razor rather than a razor blade, being careful when using knives or sharp objects, and avoiding certain contact sports with a high risk of injury. Additional measures some people take include avoiding ice and other slippery surfaces, removing tripping hazards around your home, and reducing the risk of tripping over a pet using aids such as bell collars, obedience training, and two-handed leash holds. Use your clinician as a resource to help you figure out the approaches that work best for you."
3423#15#Chest pain ,"Most people think that a heart attack is sudden, intense, and dramatic, but this is not always true. Many heart attacks start slowly as mild pain or discomfort, which builds in intensity with time. It is common for a person with a heart attack to have other symptoms, such as discomfort in one or both arms, back, neck, jaw, or stomach, shortness of breath, breaking out in a cold sweat, nausea, or light-headedness. However, some heart attacks occur without these symptoms. Studies have shown that people often delay seeking help for a heart attack because they thought the symptoms were not serious or would go away.The best advice for anyone with chest pain is to seek help immediately. Every minute that passes between the start of the attack and getting treatment means increased loss of heart muscle. (See 'When to seek help' above.)"
686#15#Hematopoietic cell transplantation (bone marrow transplantation) ,"Before undergoing hematopoietic cell transplantation, you will have a complete evaluation of your health. Your complete health history is reviewed by the transplant team. Most patients also have a number of tests.Your mental health is reviewed because of the stress and demands of stem cell transplantation; some patients meet with a mental health counselor to discuss concerns and to plan coping strategies.You will also meet with a transplant coordinator or nurse to discuss the transplant process. Because patients who receive donor bone marrow are hospitalized for several weeks to months, it is important that you have a clear understanding of what will happen and what services are available. Some patients prefer to have a friend or family member accompany them, tape record the conversation with the transplant physician, or have this information in writing so that they can review it later.In many cases, patients undergo hematopoietic cell transplantation while they are in remission from their underlying disease. You may feel well going into treatment, but you should be prepared to feel poorly for a period of time. You must understand that you will require intensive treatment and monitoring, but that there are long-term benefits from the treatment."
6736#6#Should I have a screening test for Down syndrome during pregnancy? ,"These are some of the reasons that patients choose to have a screening test for Down syndrome:I want as much information as possible about the health of my developing baby.If my baby has Down syndrome, I want to know while I am pregnant. Then I can learn as much as possible about the condition before birth.I am planning to deliver my baby in a community hospital. If my baby has serious birth defects associated with Down syndrome (such as heart or intestinal problems), I would rather deliver at a hospital with a special care nursery.I have been anxious since I learned I was pregnant. If I find out that my baby's chances of having Down syndrome are low, I believe it will help ease my anxiety.I want to consider all of my options. If my developing baby has Down syndrome, I would want the option to terminate the pregnancy.I am not sure what I would do, or how I would feel, if my baby has Down syndrome. I am going to take it one step at a time. If my screening test shows that the baby is at increased risk, I will decide at that time if I want to have more testing."
3997#3#Chickenpox prevention and treatment ,"In the United States, the varicella vaccine is recommended for all children at 12 through 15 months of age. A second dose is recommended at 4 to 6 years of age. The second dose may be administered earlier than age 4 years (for example, during a varicella outbreak); for such children <13 years, the two doses should be given at least three months apart. The vaccine may be given in a formulation that combines vaccines for measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella (MMRV, ProQuad). The varicella vaccine is not needed if a child is infected with chickenpox before being vaccinated. (See  ""Vaccination for the prevention of chickenpox (primary varicella infection)"".)"
1195#1#Treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children ,"Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a condition that causes trouble paying attention, hyperactivity, and impulsive behavior. It is often first recognized in early childhood. ADHD can affect a child's thinking, performance in school, behavior, feelings, and relationships with others. It often continues into adulthood.Treatments for ADHD include medicines, behavior training, counseling, and changes at school and/or at home. These treatments can be used alone or in combination. The best treatment or combination of treatments depends on your child's situation. A doctor or nurse can guide you and your child as treatment begins.The treatment of ADHD disorder in children and adolescents will be reviewed here. A topic that discusses the symptoms and diagnosis of ADHD is available separately. (See  ""Patient education: Symptoms and diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children (Beyond the Basics)"".)More detailed information about ADHD in children is available by subscription. (See  ""Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents: Clinical features and diagnosis"" and  ""Pharmacology of drugs used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents"" and  ""Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents: Overview of treatment and prognosis"".)"
1994#2#Inflammatory bowel disease and pregnancy ,"In most cases, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that is under good control does not affect a person's ability to become pregnant. However, active disease may make it more difficult to conceive. Extensive abdominal or pelvic surgery (eg, removal of the colon) can increase the risk of impotence (inability to maintain an erection) in men. In women, extensive surgery can increase the risk of infertility, usually as a result of the development scar tissue. In these cases, in vitro fertilization (IVF) can help achieve a pregnancy, though at lower rates than in the general population.A man's fertility can also be affected by one of the drugs used to treat UC, sulfasalazine (Azulfidine). This medication causes sperm abnormalities in about 80 percent of men. These abnormalities resolve when the drug is discontinued."
1170#7#Weaning from breastfeeding ,"When you are ready to initiate weaning, one option is to gradually eliminate one breastfeeding session every two to five days. Other ways to wean include shortening breastfeeding sessions slowly or lengthening the time between sessions.It may be possible to wean a child from nursing during the day and continue breastfeeding at night; this may be a good option if you are unable to pump breast milk and need to be away from your child (for example, while working or attending school). The midday feeding may be a good time to start as children tend to be most interested in nursing at the first and last feedings of the day, when their need for comfort is greater. Pre-bedtime or nighttime feedings are usually the last to be eliminated.However weaning occurs, you should watch your breasts carefully for any sign of pain, redness, or tenderness. These can be signs of plugged ducts or infection (mastitis). (See  ""Patient education: Common breastfeeding problems (Beyond the Basics)"".)Stopping breastfeeding all at once is not recommended because the breasts will become engorged, painful, and may develop mastitis. If breastfeeding must be stopped immediately for medical or other reasons, it may help to hand-express or pump milk a few times per day until your breasts feel comfortable (not empty) and milk production slows, usually over a few days (figure 1). Do not wait until your breasts are painful or very full to express milk. Wearing a well-fitting, supportive bra can be helpful. (See  ""Patient education: Pumping breast milk (Beyond the Basics)"".)"
2016#17#Peptic ulcer disease ,"Although most peptic ulcers heal completely with treatment, they can sometimes lead to complications. The risk of serious complications depends on the cause of the ulcer, the size and location of the ulcer, and the person’s age and health."
2169#4#Calcium and vitamin D for bone health ,"The primary sources of calcium in the diet include milk and other dairy products, such as hard cheese, cottage cheese, or yogurt, as well as green vegetables, such as kale and broccoli (table 1). Some cereals, soy products, and fruit juices are fortified with calcium."
4009#4#Acute sinusitis (sinus infection) ,"It is difficult to know if you have a viral or bacterial sinus infection initially. Studies show that duration of symptoms cannot always be used to distinguish between viral and bacterial sinusitis, even when lasting longer than 7 to 10 days.If symptoms of sinusitis last more than 10 days, or if you have symptoms that initially improve but then worsen again within the first 7 days (""double-worsening""), you may have bacterial sinusitis."
8414#25#Vaginal hysterectomy ,"Women who have undergone hysterectomy may experience menopause earlier than the average age of menopause (age 51). This may be due to an interruption in blood flow to the ovaries as a result of removing the uterus. Occasionally, one or both ovaries may need to be unexpectedly removed during the surgery due to injury, bleeding, or an abnormality found during the surgery."
1176#2#Diaper rash in infants and children ,"There are two main types of diaper rash:Rashes that are caused or worsened by a diaperRashes that are not related to diaper useIt is not always possible for parents to determine the type and cause of diaper rash. In most cases, it is reasonable to begin treatment at home, as described below. If the rash is severe or worsens, you should contact your child's health care provider. (See 'Diaper rash treatment' below and 'When to seek help' below.)"
2014#1#Irritable bowel syndrome ,"Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic condition of the digestive system. Its primary symptoms are abdominal pain and changes in bowel habits (eg, constipation and/or diarrhea).IBS is the most commonly diagnosed gastrointestinal condition and is second only to the common cold as a cause of absence from work. An estimated 10 to 20 percent of people in the general population experience symptoms of IBS, although only about 15 percent of affected people actually seek medical help.The chronic nature of IBS and the challenge of controlling its symptoms can be frustrating for both patients and health care providers. However, there are treatments and therapies that can help."
1185#12#Starting solid foods during infancy ,"As your child gains the ability to feed himself/herself, a greater variety of ""adult"" foods can be offered, including finely chopped, soft foods [3].Foods that are choking hazards are not recommended in children younger than four years. These foods include hot dogs, peanuts, tree nuts, grapes, raisins, raw carrots, popcorn, and round candies."
579#14#Vasculitis ,"Microscopic polyangiitis usually affects the lungs, kidneys, or nerves in the same way that GPA affects these organs. A biopsy of a lung or kidney can confirm the diagnosis. (See  ""Granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis"".)"
2016#6#Peptic ulcer disease ,"Some people with peptic ulcers do not have any symptoms. (Ulcers that cause no symptoms are sometimes called “silent ulcers.”) People who do have symptoms may experience any of the following:Upper abdominal pain or discomfort (often a burning or hunger-like feeling)Feeling full quickly when eatingStomach pain, belching, or feeling bloated after eatingHeartburn or acid reflux NauseaVomiting (in severe cases, there may be blood in the vomit)Blood in the stools (which may cause stool to appear black or tar-like)Duodenal ulcers tend to cause abdominal pain that comes on several hours after eating (often during the night); this is due to the presence of acid in the digestive tract without a food ""buffer."" Eating or taking an acid-reducing medication may relieve symptoms."
3993#3#Skin and soft tissue infection (cellulitis) ,"The most common symptom of cellulitis is dull pain or tenderness in the area of skin involvement. Other cellulitis symptoms can include swelling, warmth, and redness in a distinct area of skin. These symptoms commonly worsen, and the redness may expand over the course of hours or days. The onset of cellulitis may be gradual or sudden. Itching is not a typical symptom of cellulitis. The skin is usually smooth and shiny rather than raised or bumpy. However, occasionally in cases of cellulitis, blisters or small pimples may form in the skin. In more severe cases, fever and chills can develop.Cellulitis most commonly involves the leg; other common sites include the arm, around the eye, the breast, and on the abdominal wall. (See  ""Cellulitis following pelvic lymph node dissection"" and  ""Breast cellulitis and other skin disorders of the breast"".)"
8399#3#Vaginal dryness ,"There are several treatment options for women with vaginal dryness. Some, such as vaginal moisturizers or lubricants, are available without a prescription. Others require a prescription, including a vaginal estrogen cream, tablet, capsule, or ring; an oral medication called ospemifene; and a vaginal tablet called prasterone. These treatments usually work temporarily; your symptoms will return when the treatment is stopped unless your ovaries start producing more estrogen again."
8411#2#Permanent birth control for women ,"Having a permanent birth control procedure is a major decision; it means deciding that you never want to get pregnant in the future. This choice must be your own and not forced onto you by anyone else, including your family, partner, or health care provider.In the United States, it is not necessary to obtain the consent of your partner before having the procedure; however, it is a good idea for both you and your partner to fully understand the procedure as well as the benefits, potential risks, and alternatives. Some couples choose male permanent birth control (vasectomy) as an alternative. (See  ""Patient education: Vasectomy (Beyond the Basics)"".)Your clinician should provide an explanation of the details of the procedure, including the options for anesthesia (general, spinal, or local), and the risk of pregnancy following the procedure (see 'What to expect after a permanent birth control procedure' below), including the chance of ectopic pregnancy (when a pregnancy begins to grow outside of the uterus, usually in the fallopian tube). You can change your mind at any time before the procedure.Permanent birth control procedures should be considered a permanent and final decision to prevent future pregnancy. Reversing a tubal ligation procedure involves major surgery, is not always successful, and is rarely covered by insurance plans. A complete salpingectomy procedure (where the tubes are removed completely) is not reversible. If you think there is a possibility that you may change your mind about wanting to get pregnant in the future, you should choose a different form of birth control. There are options that are long-acting and effective but not permanent. (See 'Alternatives' below.)"
725#22#Overview of muscular dystrophies ,"Myotonic dystrophy is the most common adult-onset muscular dystrophy. It can affect both boys and girls. There are two genetic types of myotonic dystrophy, type 1 and type 2. Symptoms typically appear during adolescence or adulthood. However, in some forms of type 1 myotonic dystrophy, the symptoms affect newborns or appear during infancy or early childhood.Myotonic dystrophy affects multiple body systems, causing muscle loss and weakness, especially in the facial muscles, arms, and legs. In addition, myotonic dystrophy can cause heart problems (like heart block), cataracts, problems with glands, and abnormal intellectual functioning. In some cases, there are joint problems or difficulty swallowing. Excessive daytime sleepiness is found in about one-third of patients with myotonic dystrophy.Myotonia, or delayed muscle relaxation after contraction, is also seen, but this problem typically does not require treatment. Genetic testing, pulmonary function tests, swallowing studies, and heart tests are often used in the evaluation of myotonic dystrophy. People with myotonic dystrophy are treated as symptoms develop. Leg braces are often used as weakness in the legs and feet worsen.Life expectancy appears to be reduced for people with myotonic dystrophy. Respiratory and cardiac diseases are the most common causes of death, but cardiac death can be prevented with the implantation of a pacemaker or with other interventions."
7631#2#Alopecia areata ,"In alopecia areata, the body's immune system mistakenly attacks the hair follicles for reasons that are not clear. Fortunately, the follicles retain their ability to regrow hair, and the hair loss is not permanent in most cases.Other conditions can occur along with alopecia areata; these may include vitiligo (a disorder that causes patchy whitening of the skin), thyroiditis (inflammation of the thyroid gland), and pernicious anemia (a decrease in the number of red blood cells due to a vitamin B12 deficiency). Approximately 20 percent of people with alopecia areata have a family member who is also affected. Based on this, experts believe that some people have a genetic predisposition to the disease. A person who has a close relative with alopecia areata has a slightly increased risk of developing it as well. If the relative experienced hair loss before the age of 30, the risk is increased further."
6726#9#Preterm labor ,Ultrasound measurement of the cervix can help to predict the risk of preterm birth; the risk increases as cervical length decreases. A cervix ≤20 mm measured by transvaginal ultrasound in the second trimester is considered short and predictive of an increased risk of preterm birth.
2175#14#Evaluation of infertility in couples ,"Uterine abnormalities that can contribute to infertility include congenital structural abnormalities, such as a uterine septum (a band of tissue that divides the uterine cavity) (figure 5); fibroids (benign growths); polyps; and structural abnormalities that can result from gynecologic procedures.Scarring and obstruction of the fallopian tubes can occur as a result of pelvic inflammatory disease, endometriosis, or pelvic adhesions (scar tissue) from abdominal infection or surgery."
684#1#Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in adults ,"Chronic myeloid leukemia (also called CML or chronic myelogenous leukemia) is a chronic (long-term, slowly developing) form of leukemia. Leukemia is a type of cancer of cells in the blood and bone marrow (the spongy, red tissue that fills large bones).People with CML have an increase in the number of immature (young) white blood cells in their blood, bone marrow, and spleen. Some people have no symptoms when they are diagnosed with CML, and it is discovered when blood tests are done for another reason. Abnormalities in blood tests include increased platelets, anemia, and a high white blood cell count. Other people have symptoms such as enlargement of the spleen (with a feeling of fullness in the abdomen), fatigue, bone pain, fevers, night sweats, and/or weight loss. Symptoms of CML typically develop gradually. In a small percentage of people, CML transforms into an aggressive form of acute leukemia with more severe symptoms and increasingly abnormal white blood cells (called leukemic blast cells).CML occurs when a cell in the bone marrow undergoes a breakage of two chromosomes (chromosomes 9 and 22), which then fuse to form a characteristic abnormal chromosome, called the Philadelphia chromosome (named for the city in which it was first identified). The chromosome fusion causes an exchange of genetic information in which two separate genes, BCR and ABL1, are joined together. The resultant abnormal gene, called BCR-ABL1, causes bone marrow cells to produce an abnormal protein (the BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase), which stimulates CML cells to grow and survive better than normal blood cells.People with CML develop the chromosome/gene abnormality during their lifetime; that is, it is not something that you are born with or pass on to your children. Its cause is unknown.CML cells can crowd out the development of normal blood cells in the bone marrow. The main types of normal blood cells are:White blood cells – Neutrophils are a type of white blood cell that help to fight infection. People with neutropenia (low numbers of neutrophils) are more likely to get infections. Red blood cells – Red blood cells carry oxygen to the body's organs and tissues. People who are anemic (meaning they do not have enough red blood cells) may be pale, tired, and/or short of breath.Platelets – Platelets help to prevent and stop bleeding. People with low platelets (thrombocytopenia) can have bleeding and spontaneous bruising. People with high platelets can have clotting or also increased risk of bleeding.More detailed information about CML, written for healthcare providers, is available by subscription. (See 'Professional level information' below.)"
1173#2#Asthma inhaler techniques in children ,"Metered dose inhalers (MDIs) are used to deliver a variety of inhaled medications. An MDI consists of a pressurized canister, a metering valve and stem, and a mouthpiece actuator (picture 1).The inhaler canister contains the medicine and other chemicals that help to deliver the medication to the lungs. Previously, inhalers contained a chemical known to damage the ozone layer. As a result, most inhalers in the United States were reformulated after December 2008. The new inhalers use a chemical called hydrofluoroalkane (HFA) to deliver the medication to the lungs. HFA devices may have a different taste compared with the previous inhalers, and the spray may feel softer. However, this does not mean that the medicine is not reaching your lungs.In addition, HFA inhalers need to be cleaned and primed to prevent medication build up and blockage. Each manufacturer will provide instructions about how to use their inhaler. These instructions should be reviewed carefully. (See 'How to use an MDI' below.)HFA inhalers may be more expensive than the older inhaler. Talk to your health care provider if you have difficulty paying for your medications because assistance programs may be available."
7632#13#Poison ivy ,"The best way to prevent poison ivy dermatitis is to identify and avoid the plants that cause it. These plants can irritate the skin year round, even during the winter months, and they can still cause a reaction after dying.Wear protective clothing, including long sleeves and pants, when working in areas where toxic plants may be found. Keep in mind that the resin and oils from the toxic plants can be carried on clothing, pets, and under fingernails.Wear heavy-duty vinyl gloves when doing yard work or gardening. The oils from toxic plants can seep through latex or rubber gloves.After coming in contact with poison ivy, remove any contaminated clothing. As soon as possible (minutes count, but you can try up to two hours later), wash under very warm or hot running water using dishwashing liquid on a damp washcloth. Wash your entire body three times, while always wiping in one direction and not back and forth. This seems to reduce irritation and help remove the oils. If you do not have rapid access to dishwashing liquid, try to use plain water and wipe your skin in the same fashion; you will at least get rid of some of the resin. Comparison of dishwashing liquid with more expensive products made for removing poison ivy oils did not show a difference in effectiveness.Creams and ointments that create a barrier between the skin and the urushiol oil may be somewhat effective for people who are frequently exposed to poison ivy.Avoid burning poisonous vegetation, which can disperse the plant particles in the smoke, irritate the skin, and cause poison ivy dermatitis."
4645#5#Flexible bronchoscopy ,"During bronchoscopy, a thin tube called a bronchoscope is placed in the nose or mouth. The bronchoscope has a very small camera at its tip that displays pictures on a video screen or camera. Bronchoscopy is usually done with a flexible tube (flexible bronchoscopy). However, in a small number of cases, a more rigid tube is required (rigid bronchoscopy). The information provided here is relevant to people undergoing flexible bronchoscopy.The bronchoscope will be placed into either the nose or the mouth, then advanced slowly down the back of the throat, through the vocal cords and into the airways. Some people have an urge to cough or feel a sensation of wanting to catch their breath. If there is significant discomfort, more anesthesia can be given.Once the bronchoscope has passed between the vocal cords, it is difficult to speak normally. This can be frightening, but it is expected and resolves when the bronchoscope is removed. Oxygen levels are monitored at all times to be sure you are getting enough air."
1191#6#Blood in the urine (hematuria) in children ,"The evaluation of a child with hematuria depends upon the type of hematuria (microscopic or gross) and the child's history, symptoms, and physical examination.If the child has microscopic hematuria, but has no symptoms (pain, fever, recent trauma) and no protein in the urine, a urine test will be repeated several times over a few months to determine if the blood persists. No further testing is needed. Urine calcium may also be checked to see if there is an increased amount of calcium in the urine. If the microscopic hematuria does not resolve, and your child continues to have no symptoms and no protein in the urine, the child will be monitored over time. The child may be referred to a pediatric nephrologist (kidney specialist) if hematuria persists.If the child has hematuria and has symptoms of a bladder or kidney infection, testing will be done to confirm the diagnosis. This usually includes a urine culture.If the child has hematuria and symptoms suggestive of a kidney stone, testing with an ultrasound or computed tomography (CT) scan of the kidney is performed to confirm the presence and location of a kidney stone. A urine sample will be collected over 24 hours to measure substances that cause kidney stones.If the child has had a recent injury, an imaging test may be recommended to examine the kidneys, ureters, and bladder.If the child has hematuria and protein in the urine, further testing will be done. This includes blood and urine tests to evaluate the child's kidney function. The child's blood pressure will also be measured because high blood pressure is a common finding in children with kidney problems. The child may be referred to a pediatric nephrologist if the tests are abnormal.Family members of children with persistent hematuria may also be tested. Familial hematuria, which has no serious long-term effects, is the most common cause of persistent microscopic hematuria in children."
3439#3#Heart transplantation ,"The primary task in selecting candidates for heart transplantation is the person's prognosis. There are many predictors of need for transplantation; one of the best predictors is the amount of oxygen required by the body, called VO2. This is measured as a person exercises on a treadmill. Poor heart function despite excellent medical therapy is another very important predictor of poor prognosis.The major reason for cardiac transplantation is to improve survival. Thus, being able to predict how a person will do after transplantation is the most important part of the patient selection process.The benefit of transplantation is clear if a person requires continuous intravenous medications in the hospital. In unhospitalized patients, the following requirements have been recommended for consideration for cardiac transplantation:A history of repeated hospitalizations for heart failureNeed for ventricular assist device or artificial heart to support circulationIncreasing types, doses, and complexity of medicationsA reproducible VO2 of less than 14 mL/kg per minutePatients are stratified into low, medium, and high risk of death without transplant. The final decision about listing a patient for transplant is determined by an established cardiac transplant center."
1993#2#Anal fissure ,"Patients with an anal fissure may first note bleeding and a sensation of tearing, ripping, or burning following a bowel movement. Once a fissure develops, these symptoms can occur after every bowel movement; the rectal pain can be severe and can last several minutes to hours.Bleeding is usually of a small volume, though it is often bright red. However, the bleeding may discolor the toilet bowl, giving it the appearance of heavy bleeding. Some patients also note itching or irritation of the skin around the anus."
699#14#Paget disease of bone (osteitis deformans) ,Paget disease may be diagnosed with x-rays. Changes in the bones seen on x-ray may include thickening of the outside of the bone (the cortex) and enlargement or deformity of the bone itself. X-rays are usually done after a bone scan to evaluate the affected bones. The information gained from an x-ray is usually sufficient to make the diagnosis of Paget disease.
4013#1#Sore throat in adults ,"A sore throat is a common problem and usually is caused by a viral or bacterial infection. The medical term for a sore throat is ""pharyngitis."" It usually resolves on its own without complications in adults, although it is important to know when to seek medical attention.Viruses can cause a sore throat and other upper respiratory infections, such as the common cold. Sore throat caused by a common cold virus is not treated with antibiotics but instead may be treated with rest, pain medication, and other therapies aimed at relieving symptoms.Strep throat is a particular kind of pharyngitis that is caused by a bacterium known as group A Streptococcus (GAS). Strep throat is treated with a course of antibiotics.A topic that discusses sore throat in children is available separately. (See  ""Patient education: Sore throat in children (Beyond the Basics)"".)"
1992#8#Upper endoscopy ,"Most patients tolerate endoscopy very well and feel fine afterwards. Some fatigue is common after the examination, and you should plan to take it easy and relax the rest of the day.The endoscopist can describe the result of the examination before you leave the endoscopy facility. If biopsies have been taken or polyps removed, you should call for results at a time specified by the endoscopist, typically within one week."
699#17#Paget disease of bone (osteitis deformans) ,"Bisphosphonates inhibit the breakdown and removal of bone by inhibiting the osteoclast. The nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates include alendronate, risedronate, pamidronate, and zoledronic acid. The first two are given by mouth, and the last two are given by infusion.Bisphosphonates are usually given for a limited period of time, followed by a period of monitoring (see 'Medication monitoring' below). These drugs offer the possibility of a long-lasting remission. However, if problems recur, treatment may be repeated. While taking a bisphosphonate, it is important to consume calcium and vitamin D every day in amounts recommended by your clinician. Calcium and vitamin D can be taken as a supplement (table 1); many foods and drinks contain calcium (table 2).Zoledronic acid is given as an infusion into a vein over 15 to 20 minutes. It is the preferred drug for treatment because it is generally well-tolerated and offers patients a prolonged remission of Paget's disease. (See 'Side effects of bisphosphonates' below.)Alendronate and risedronate are also effective. These medications are pills taken daily by mouth for two to six months. These need to be taken first thing in the morning on an empty stomach with a full 8 ounce (approximately 240 mL) glass of plain water (not sparkling). Liquids other than plain water, such as mineral water, coffee, or juice, may interfere with absorption of the medication from the stomach and intestine. After taking alendronate or risedronate, the person must remain upright so the medicine reaches the stomach (sitting or standing, not lying down) and must wait 30 minutes before eating or drinking anything.Pamidronate is an older, less potent bisphosphonate that is also effective in many patients with Paget disease. It is given as an infusion into a vein over two to four hours. Reports of resistance to pamidronate and more frequent biochemical relapses in patients with Paget disease have led clinicians to choose zoledronic acid more often than pamidronate when giving an infusion.Sometimes other bisphosphonates are used, depending upon cost and availability in individual countries."
2159#11#Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) ,"Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists (eg, leuprolide acetate or goserelin acetate) are a type of medication that causes the ovaries to temporarily stop making estrogen and progesterone. This causes a temporary menopause and improves the physical symptoms (eg, bloating) and irritability caused by PMS and PMDD. However, the medication results in extremely low estrogen levels, which causes severe hot flashes and bone loss over time. Therefore, in addition to the GnRH agonist, women are treated with low doses of estrogen and progesterone to stop hot flashes and to prevent bone loss. Although this treatment is very effective, it is complicated and expensive and is only used if other treatments do not work."
4020#2#Gonorrhea ,"Gonorrhea is caused by bacteria known as Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Gonorrhea can be spread from one person to another during oral, vaginal/penile, or anal sex. A man does not have to ejaculate to spread the infection. You cannot become infected with gonorrhea by touching objects, like a toilet seat.Your risk of getting gonorrhea is greater if you have a new sexual partner, more than one sexual partner, or if you have other sexually transmitted infections."
3995#4#Giardia ,"The organism that causes Giardia is killed by cooking, so properly cooked food rarely leads to infection. However, uncooked food or food that is contaminated after cooking can cause Giardia infections. (See  ""Patient education: Foodborne illness (food poisoning) (Beyond the Basics)"".)"
3443#13#Medications for angina ,"Beta blockers reduce the heart rate, blood pressure, and the force of the heart's contractions, thereby decreasing the amount of oxygen the heart requires to pump blood. Along with nitrates, beta blockers are usually the first choice for the treatment of stable angina, and they are particularly beneficial in people who have angina during exercise or activity.Another important benefit of beta blockers is that they improve survival and prevent another heart attack in people who have suffered a recent heart attack.Most beta blockers are available as a long-acting preparation that is taken once per day."
6725#9#Postterm pregnancy ,"Risks to the mother are related to the larger size of postterm fetuses and include difficulties during labor, an increase in injury to the perineum (including the vagina, labia, and rectum) at vaginal birth, and an increased rate of cesarean birth with its associated risks of bleeding, infection, and injury to surrounding organs."
1989#14#Exercise ,"Cool-down exercises should be done for approximately five minutes at the end of an exercise session. Similar to the warm-up period, cool-down may include low-level aerobic exercise (such as slow walking), calisthenics, and stretching. This allows the body to clear acid that has built up in the muscles and allows more blood back into the circulation because less is sent to the muscles. This helps to prevent muscle cramps and sudden drops in blood pressure that can cause lightheadedness."
3990#6#Lyme disease prevention ,"The repellent that is most commonly used against ticks in the United States is DEET (N,N-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide). Products with 10 to 30 percent DEET are adequate in most cases. The higher the concentration of DEET in a product, the longer it lasts. It is important to read the label, so you know how much DEET is in the products you are using, and follow the manufacturer's instructions to determine how frequently to reapply. It is important to talk with a health care provider about recommendations for using DEET on children. Used as directed, products that contain DEET appear to be safe for children older than two months of age. However, guidelines suggest products with more than 30 percent DEET should not be used on children.Rarely, DEET can cause hives and blister-like lesions in some adults and children. There have also been occasional reports of neurologic reactions in small children exposed to excessive amounts of DEET; however, this appears to be very rare and limited to situations involving exposure to much more DEET than is present in most insect repellents. "
4416#7#High blood pressure in adults ,"Although the exact cause of primary hypertension remains unclear, several risk factors have been identified. Your risk is higher if you:Are older (the risk increases with advancing age)Have obesityHave a family history of hypertension (ie, relatives who had or have high blood pressure)Are BlackConsume a lot of sodium (salt) in your dietDrink a lot of alcoholDo not get a lot of physical activity"
380#17#Nonallergic rhinitis (runny or stuffy nose) ,"""Gustatory rhinitis"" is the term used to describe the sudden onset of watery nasal discharge with eating, especially foods that are spicy or heated (such as soup)."
882#1#Lymphedema after cancer surgery ,"Lymphedema is swelling caused by a buildup of fluid and fat that happens most commonly in the arms, legs, or face in people who have been treated for cancer. Lymphedema is one of the most troubling complications that can develop after cancer surgery. Many people find that lymphedema worsens the physical and emotional strain of living with (or following treatment for) cancer.The risk of developing lymphedema depends upon the type of surgery performed, individual factors such as obesity or weight gain after surgery, treatment factors such as radiation or some types of chemotherapy, and complications after surgery, including infections or fluid collections (called ""seromas""). More detailed information about lymphedema, written for healthcare providers, is available by subscription. (See 'Professional level information' below.)"
1744#6#Blood glucose monitoring in diabetes ,"There is no single blood glucose meter that is better than others. Your health care provider or pharmacist can help you choose a meter based on your preferences as well as other factors like cost, ease of use, and accuracy; it should be one that is approved by either the International Organization for Standardization or the US Food and Drug Administration. Many insurance providers cover the cost of specific meters and/or supplies. Medicare also covers costs of blood glucose monitoring. "
699#15#Paget disease of bone (osteitis deformans) ,"Many patients with Paget disease do not have symptoms and do not need treatment. However, treatment may be recommended to decrease the risk of future complications, even if the person has no current symptoms. This may include people who have involvement of the skull, spine, or lower limbs."
2013#1#Hemorrhoids ,"Hemorrhoids are enlarged or swollen veins in the lower rectum. The most common symptoms of hemorrhoids are rectal bleeding, itching, and pain. You may be able to see or feel hemorrhoids around the outside of the anus, or they may be hidden from view, inside the rectum (figure 1A-B).Hemorrhoids are common, occurring in both men and women. Although hemorrhoids do not usually cause serious health problems, they can be annoying and uncomfortable. Fortunately, treatments for hemorrhoids are available and can usually minimize the bothersome symptoms.More detailed information about hemorrhoids is available by subscription. (See  ""Hemorrhoids: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis"" and  ""Home and office treatment of symptomatic hemorrhoids"".)"
873#5#Bladder cancer diagnosis and staging ,"Pain may also be a sign of bladder cancer. Pain may develop in the flank (the sides of the mid-back), above the pubic bone, or in the perineum (the area between the vagina or scrotum and the anus). Pain in the flank region can develop when there is complete or partial blockage of the ureter (the tube connecting kidney to bladder) (figure 1) on that side, with the pain being due to back pressure of urine.Pain can also occur during ""voiding"" (urinating); this is called dysuria."
3693#17#Initial treatment of HIV ,"Proteases are enzymes that HIV requires to copy itself. When protease inhibitors are used, HIV makes copies of itself that cannot infect new cells. This can reduce the amount of virus in the blood and increase the number of T cells. Commonly used protease inhibitors include darunavir and atazanavir. These medications should be administered in combination with another medication (ritonavir or cobicistat) to make sure that you get the right levels in your blood. Detailed information about the side effects and best ways to take these medicines is available in a separate topic review and at the National Institutes of Health AIDS information website. (See  ""Patient education: Tips for taking HIV medications by mouth (Beyond the Basics)"".)"
858#27#Breast cancer guide to diagnosis and treatment ,"Women with stage I and II breast cancers are treated similarly, with minor exceptions. Two surgical options are available for treating localized breast cancer: mastectomy (removal of the breast) and breast-conserving surgery (removal of the cancerous tissue, called lumpectomy).Breast-conserving therapy (BCT) consists of breast-conserving surgery (lumpectomy), which may also be referred to as wide excision, quadrantectomy, or partial mastectomy. BCT also requires radiation therapy to reduce the chances of cancer coming back in the same breast. However, there are some patients for whom radiation therapy to the remaining breast may not be necessary, particularly older patients who have small, node-negative cancers that are hormone receptor positive. The combination of surgery and radiation usually results in cosmetically acceptable preservation of the breast without compromising breast cancer outcomes.In centers that specialize in breast cancer treatment, approximately 60 percent of women with early-stage breast cancer are candidates for BCT. In 25 to 50 percent of women, there are medical, cosmetic, and/or social and emotional reasons for having a mastectomy rather than BCT. However, assuming that the patient is considered a good candidate for BCT, survival outcomes are the same whether BCT or mastectomy is performed. (See  ""Patient education: Surgical procedures for breast cancer — Mastectomy and breast-conserving therapy (Beyond the Basics)"".)Radiation therapy to the chest wall and surrounding lymph node areas may also be recommended for patients who have had a mastectomy. Factors such as positive lymph nodes, large tumors, and positive margins play into the decision.Breast reconstruction is an important option for women who undergo mastectomy and may be considered at the time of the mastectomy or at a later date. Consultation with a plastic surgeon prior to the mastectomy is essential if immediate reconstruction is desired. Knowledge of the need for postmastectomy radiation may influence the plastic surgeon's decision as to the timing of the reconstruction (immediate or delayed)."
2169#3#Calcium and vitamin D for bone health ,"Premenopausal women and men should consume at least 1000 mg of calcium, while postmenopausal women should consume 1200 mg (total diet plus supplement). You should not consume more than 2000 mg of calcium per day (total diet plus supplement) due to the risk of side effects."
1214#1#Why does my child need vaccines? ,"Vaccines are one of the most effective ways to prevent serious illness in children and adults. Vaccine programs in the United States have been quite successful in reducing the number of children affected by many highly contagious diseases, including measles, rubella, mumps, diphtheria, and polio.The following is a discussion of how vaccines work, common side effects, reasons to avoid a particular vaccine, and common concerns about vaccines. Separate articles discuss specific vaccine recommendations for children and adults. (See  ""Patient education: Vaccines for infants and children age 0 to 6 years (Beyond the Basics)"" and  ""Patient education: Vaccines for children age 7 to 18 years (Beyond the Basics)"" and  ""Patient education: Vaccines for adults (Beyond the Basics)"".)"
1223#12#Nausea and vomiting in infants and children ,"If a breastfeeding infant vomits, he or she should continue to breastfeed unless your doctor or nurse tells you otherwise. Oral rehydration solutions (eg, Pedialyte) are not usually needed for infants who exclusively breastfeed, because breastmilk is more easily digested.If your infant vomits immediately after nursing, you can try to breastfeed more frequently and for a shorter time. For example, breastfeed every 30 minutes for 5 to 10 minutes. If vomiting improves after two to three hours, resume the usual feeding schedule. If vomiting worsens or does not improve within 24 hours, call your child's doctor or nurse. (See 'When to seek help' below.)If your infant drinks formula, initially offer one-half to one ounce of an oral rehydration solution (eg, Pedialyte) every 15 minutes for two to three hours. If vomiting occurs after drinking, wait 30 minutes and try again. If vomiting improves, resume feeding with full-strength infant formula. If vomiting worsens or does not improve within 24 hours, call your child's doctor or nurse. (See 'When to seek help' below.)"
4866#13#Depression treatment options for adults ,"We suggest combining formal treatment with some add-on activities that may help to alleviate depression and any accompanying anxiety symptoms. Among these are relaxation techniques (such as progressive muscle relaxation) and exercise. We also suggest that people resume the activities they stopped doing because of their depression. People sometimes think that once their depression lifts, they’ll go back to doing those activities, but it turns out that resuming those activities—even while still depressed—may help turn the depression around.Exercise in particular may have an especially positive effect on depression. Several studies suggest that exercise can ease depression. We suggest three to five exercise sessions per week, that last 45 to 60 minutes per session, for at least 10 weeks, and that involve aerobic exercise (such as walking, running, or cycling) or resistance training (upper and lower body weight lifting)."
519#18#Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) ,"Warfarin and heparin – People using anticoagulant medications such as warfarin (brand name: Jantoven) and heparin; a newer anticoagulant such as dabigatran (brand name: Pradaxa), rivaroxaban (brand name: Xarelto), apixaban (brand name: Eliquis) or edoxaban (brand name: Savaysa); or an anti-platelet drug such as clopidogrel (brand name: Plavix), should generally not take NSAIDs or aspirin because of an increased risk of bleeding when both classes of drugs are used. (See  ""Patient education: Warfarin (Beyond the Basics)"".)Celecoxib may be safe in such instances but should be used with caution and under the guidance of a clinician.Aspirin – As noted above, the combination of low-dose aspirin and an NSAID may increase the risk of bleeding. To preserve the benefit of low-dose aspirin for the heart, aspirin should be taken at least two hours before the NSAID.Phenytoin – Taking an NSAID and phenytoin (Dilantin, Phenytek) can increase the phenytoin level. As a result, people who take phenytoin should have a blood test to monitor the phenytoin level when starting or increasing the dose of an NSAID.Cyclosporine – People who take cyclosporine (eg, to prevent rejection after an organ transplant or for a rheumatic disease, such as rheumatoid arthritis) should take particular care when taking an NSAID. There is a theoretical risk of kidney damage when cyclosporine and NSAIDs are taken together. To monitor for this complication, blood testing may be recommended.People taking one NSAID should not take a second NSAID at the same time because of the increased risk of side effects."
1194#1#Bloody stools in children ,"Seeing blood on your child's stool can be frightening. However, this is a common condition in children and is usually not serious. There are many possible causes of bloody stools, also known as ""rectal bleeding."" The most likely cause depends on the frequency and amount of blood, and on your child's age and underlying condition. A health care provider can help to determine the source of the bleeding and the most appropriate treatment.This article will review some of the common causes of bloody stools and tests that may be used to evaluate your child. Bloody stools in adults is discussed separately. (See  ""Patient education: Blood in the stool (rectal bleeding) in adults (Beyond the Basics)"".)"
6732#1#Chorionic villus sampling ,"Chorionic villus sampling (CVS) is a procedure that may be performed during pregnancy to diagnose certain genetic or chromosomal disorders. CVS involves having a biopsy of the developing placenta. The chorionic villi are the tiny units that make up the placenta and have the same genetic make-up as the fetus.More detailed information about CVS is available by subscription. (See  ""Chorionic villus sampling"".)"
682#27#Blood donation and transfusion ,"Autologous blood donation is when a donor donates blood for her or himself several days to six weeks ahead of a scheduled surgery, when blood might be needed. Autologous blood donation reduces the risk of most, but not all, infectious complications of blood transfusion."
4866#1#Depression treatment options for adults ,"Clinical depression is a medical condition that goes beyond everyday sadness. Depression may cause serious, long-lasting symptoms and often disrupts a person’s ability to perform routine tasks. The disorder is the most common psychiatric disorder worldwide. In the United States, about one in six people experiences a bout of clinical depression in their lifetime.The treatment of depression is important because people with untreated depression have a lower quality of life, a higher risk of suicide, and worse physical outcomes if they have any medical conditions besides depression. In fact, people with depression are almost twice as likely to die as people without the condition. What’s more, depression affects not only the people with the disorder but also those around them.This topic reviews the initial treatment of depression in adults. The clinical features and diagnosis of depression in adults are discussed separately, as are the diagnosis and treatment of depression in children and adolescents (See  ""Patient education: Depression in adults (Beyond the Basics)"" and  ""Patient education: Depression in children and adolescents (Beyond the Basics)"" and  ""Patient education: Depression treatment options for children and adolescents (Beyond the Basics)"".)More detailed information about depression is available by subscription.

881#25#Surgical procedures for breast cancer — Mastectomy and breast-conserving therapy ,"Although cancer outcomes are similar, there are several factors that you should consider when trying to decide between BCT and mastectomy. Tumor size – Some women who have a large tumor and small breasts are advised to undergo mastectomy rather than BCT. However, chemotherapy may be given before surgery to shrink the tumor; this may allow the woman to have breast-conserving surgery, if she desires it. Extensive DCIS – Extensive ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), a very early cancer, does not respond well to chemotherapy and therefore may necessitate a mastectomy in order to make sure that all the disease is removed.Tumor margins – After lumpectomy, it is important to have a margin of normal breast tissue around the tumor. If cancer cells are found at or near the edges of the tissue removed, additional surgery may be necessary. If a large amount of tissue has been removed and the margins are still involved, mastectomy may be recommended.Need for radiation – For most women, BCT involves both lumpectomy and radiation. While radiation does allow for preservation of the breast, there are both immediate and long-term side effects. Mastectomy is often recommended in women who prefer to avoid radiation. (See  ""Radiation therapy techniques for newly diagnosed, non-metastatic breast cancer"".)Individual needs and preferences – You should discuss your preferences and concerns about preserving your breast with your doctor. Risk of a second breast cancer – Some women may be candidates for BCT but may be at a high risk of developing another breast cancer. These include very young women, women with a strong family history of breast cancer (such as several family members with cancers at young ages or in multiple generations), or women with a known breast cancer gene mutation. These women are still candidates for BCT but may wish to undergo bilateral mastectomy to not only treat the known cancer but prevent a second cancer in the future. (See 'Contralateral prophylactic mastectomy' above.)"
682#18#Blood donation and transfusion ,"Donated blood cannot be tested for every possible infection, and new types of infections are frequently emerging around the world. The pre-donation educational material given to donors, as well as the questionnaire, includes several general questions that are designed to identify individuals who either have infection symptoms or who have travelled to locations where these infections are more common. These questions are directed at general signs of infection, and individuals who might be at risk of transmitting an infection due to travel or behaviors are asked to ""self-defer"" (to avoid donating blood). The decision to self-defer can be made at the time of donation or after the donation has been completed (in which case the center will not use or distribute the donated blood). In addition, the blood center educational materials inform donors that they should call the blood center if specific medical symptoms that could indicate an active infection develop in the two weeks following donation; this is done so that the donated unit can be removed from the blood supply. "
1748#2#Type 2 diabetes and diet ,"Making changes to your diet is a key part of managing type 2 diabetes.You may have heard of the ""ABCs of diabetes."" This refers to three aspects of your health that should be well-controlled in order to manage your diabetes: A1C (a blood test that measures your average blood sugar level over the past few months), Blood pressure, and Cholesterol. Keeping your blood sugar at or near your goal level helps decrease the risk of complications that can affect the eyes, kidneys, and nerves. Keeping your blood pressure and cholesterol levels under control helps reduce your risk of cardiovascular (heart) disease, which is a common complication of type 2 diabetes. (See  ""Patient education: High blood pressure, diet, and weight (Beyond the Basics)"" and  ""Patient education: High cholesterol and lipids (Beyond the Basics)"".)Many factors affect how well a person's diabetes is controlled. You can reduce your risk of complications by following your health care provider's guidance around diet, exercise, blood sugar monitoring, and medication regimens. Dietary changes are typically focused on eating nutritious foods and getting to (and maintaining) a healthy weight. If you take insulin, you may also need to be consistent about what you eat and when.Having to pay careful attention to your diet can be challenging. It can help to work with a dietitian to create a plan that is tailored to your specific situation (including what diabetes medications you take), lifestyle, and personal preferences."
6724#8#Miscarriage ,"At approximately 6 weeks after the last menstrual period, the motion of the fetal heart should be visible on ultrasound. If the pregnancy has progressed to the stage where a heartbeat should be present, the failure to detect a heartbeat during an ultrasound exam indicates that the pregnancy has likely ended.On the other hand, the presence of a fetal heart beat (in the absence of other abnormalities in the pregnancy) indicates the pregnancy may still be viable and that miscarriage may not occur.Doctors will also evaluate the rate of the fetal heart. A fetal heart beat that is less than 100 to 120 beats per minute can indicate that a miscarriage is likely."
383#1#Bee and insect stings ,"Being stung by a bee, wasp, hornet, or yellow jacket can be both painful and scary. Some people have serious or even life-threatening reactions to stings, which requires quick treatment.This article will review the most common types of stings, reactions to stings, and recommended treatments. More detailed information about stings is available by subscription. (See  ""Bee, yellow jacket, wasp, and other Hymenoptera stings: Reaction types and acute management"".)"
854#12#Pancreatic cancer ,"Chemoradiotherapy often requires a central venous access catheter (often called a ""port""). This is a tube that is surgically inserted into one of the large blood vessels in the chest. Chemoradiotherapy often requires a portable chemotherapy pump; this is a small, battery-operated pump that fits into a pack that can be worn around the waist. The pump gives the chemotherapy medicine into the port continuously for five to six weeks.During this time, the patient is treated with radiation therapy five days per week. The radiation is delivered while the patient lies on a table underneath or in front of the machine. The treatment takes only a few seconds (similar to having an x-ray).Sometimes the chemotherapy pump is not covered by health insurance. In this case, an oral (pill) form of chemotherapy or another type of intravenous (IV) chemotherapy can be substituted. Radiation therapy is given five days per week. This combination probably works as well as the chemotherapy pump plus radiation therapy, although formal studies comparing the two approaches have not been done."
1199#8#Bedwetting in children ,"You should speak with your child's health care provider if your child has difficulty with needing to urinate frequently or urgently, extreme thirst during the day, burning with urination, swelling in the feet or ankles, or a new problem with bedwetting after weeks or months of being dry. These may be signs of a more serious condition that should be evaluated before any enuresis treatment is attempted.If your child does not have the above problems, you may seek medical advice at any time, or you may try following the general advice or motivational therapy techniques described below. Motivational therapy techniques are best suited to younger children with enuresis. Most clinicians do not suggest alarm devices or medications until a child is at least six years old."
1216#27#Vaccines for infants and children age 0 to 6 years ,"There are two ways for children to receive the flu vaccine: as a shot into muscle (intramuscular injection, also known as simply the ""flu shot"") or as a nasal spray. Your child's health care provider can talk to you about the options, and you can decide together which one is best for your child.The flu shot can be given to adults and children 6 months of age and older, while the nasal spray is approved only for those 2 through 49 years of age.The influenza vaccine must be given every year (ideally in the fall or early winter in the northern hemisphere). The main reason for this is that protection from influenza vaccine decreases over time. Yearly vaccination also allows the vaccine to be reformulated if the influenza viruses change from year to year. In the first year that a child younger than nine years receives the vaccine, two doses are recommended; the second dose is given at least one month after the first. In subsequent years, most children will need only one dose.Children who have a fever (higher than 100.4°F [38°C]) should wait to get the vaccine until the fever resolves. However, children with mild illnesses that do not cause a fever can get the vaccine."
682#25#Blood donation and transfusion ,Safety measures such as improved screening tests have dramatically reduced the risk of acquiring a viral infection from a blood transfusion. The likelihood of getting one of these infections from a blood transfusion is lower than the likelihood of dying in a car crash or of being killed by a firearm. Estimates of the risks of developing certain infections after receiving a unit of blood in the United States include the following:1 in 1 million to 1 in 1.5 million for hepatitis B virus1 in 2 million to 1 in 2.6 million for hepatitis C virus1 in 1.6 million to 1 in 2.3 million for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)The ranges are provided because different blood organizations have slightly different estimates.
4868#3#Depression in adults ,"When people talk about so-called “clinical depression,” they’re usually referring to what health care providers call major depression (also called major depressive disorder or unipolar major depression). To be diagnosed with major depression, a person must have five or more of the following symptoms present most of the day nearly every day for at least two consecutive weeks. For the diagnosis, at least one symptom must be either depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure.Depressed mood – People with depression tend to feel sad, hopeless, discouraged, “blue,” or “down in the dumps.” Sometimes they describe this as feeling “blah” or having no feelings. Plus, some people with depression feel anxious, annoyed, frustrated, irritable, or angry.Loss of interest or pleasure in most or all activities – People with depression are no longer as interested in or feel as much pleasure doing the things they used to enjoy. The medical term for this is anhedonia. Hobbies and activities lose their appeal, and depressed people say “they don’t care anymore.” They may withdraw from or lose interest in friends, social activities, or hobbies. Many depressed people lose interest in sex.Change in appetite or weight – Appetite and weight can either decrease or increase as part of depression. Some people have to force themselves to eat, while others eat more and sometimes crave specific foods (such as junk food and carbohydrates). Some people with severe depression can gain or lose so much weight that they have health problems related to their weight change.Insomnia or hypersomnia (sleeping too little or too much) – Depression often disrupts sleep patterns, leading people to either sleep too much or be unable to fall asleep or stay asleep. Even when they do sleep, people with depression often say that they do not feel rested and have a hard time getting out of bed in the morning.Psychomotor agitation or slowing (restlessness or sluggishness) – People with depression can feel agitated and restless, or have the opposite effect and feel slowed down. Agitation can manifest as hand-wringing, pacing, or fidgeting, while slowing can manifest as a reduction of body movements or a sense of slowed thinking or speaking.Fatigue or loss of energy – People with depression often feel exhausted and listless. They sometimes need to rest during the day or even feel as though their arms and legs are weighted down. Many have trouble starting or completing tasks.Feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt – People with depression can feel inadequate, inferior, worthless, or like a failure. They often carry tremendous guilt about things that they may have done or not done. Often this leads them to misinterpret neutral events or minor setbacks as evidence of personal failings.Poor concentration – Some people with depression have trouble thinking clearly, concentrating, or making decisions. They can also be easily distracted or complain of memory problems.Recurrent thoughts of death or suicide – People who are depressed can experience recurrent thoughts of death or suicide, and may attempt suicide. Thoughts of death or suicide, termed “suicidal ideation,” can be passive, meaning the person thinks simply that life is not worth living. Suicidal ideation can also be active, meaning the person actively wants to die or kill themselves. People with any form of suicidal ideation need prompt medical attention.Some people have specific plans for suicide or have started making preparations. Preparations can take the form of selecting a time and place for suicide or buying a stockpile of lethal medications or a gun. Some have even made unsuccessful attempts at suicide, and some die by suicide.Suicidality gets worse when people feel hopeless and see suicide as their only escape from intense and endless emotional pain.Some people with depression hurt themselves, for example by superficially cutting or burning their skin.Other symptoms of depression can include anxiety, hopelessness, and ruminative thinking (tending to dwell on the same negative thoughts)."
681#13#Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) treatment in adults ,"Your chances of being cured of AML depend upon a number of factors, including your age, other health conditions, how aggressive your AML is, and whether you have ever been treated with chemotherapy for another disorder before your AML diagnosis. In one study, approximately 65, 40, and 15 percent of people with favorable, intermediate, and unfavorable risk disease, respectively, were alive five years after diagnosis.However, when discussing chances of cure, it is important to remember that these numbers represent averages and do not necessarily predict what will happen to you."
580#9#Sjögren's syndrome ,"A salivary gland biopsy may be recommended to aid in the diagnosis of Sjögren's syndrome, particularly if the tests for Ro/SSA and La/SSB antibodies are negative. The biopsy is done by removing a small piece of tissue from the inner portion of the lip for testing."
881#29#Surgical procedures for breast cancer — Mastectomy and breast-conserving therapy ,"This procedure involves removing most of the lymph nodes in the axilla (armpit). In the past, this was performed for all women with invasive breast cancer, but it can be associated with complications such as pain and lymphedema (arm swelling). An axillary lymph node dissection is now usually performed only for patients when cancerous lymph nodes can be felt in the axilla or when the sentinel lymph node excision reveals multiple nodes containing cancer or a large burden of cancer cells. An axillary lymph node dissection may also be recommended for women who still have cancer in the lymph nodes following neoadjuvant chemotherapy. (See 'Sentinel lymph node definition' below and 'Sentinel lymph node excision' below.)"
873#15#Bladder cancer diagnosis and staging ,"Several factors are used to describe a bladder cancer as low, intermediate, or high risk based upon the likelihood of cancer recurrence and progressions. These factors include the size, number, and appearance of the tumor(s), if it recurs, and how deeply it invades into the bladder. These risk groupings impact the type of treatment used by clinicians.A person whose cancer is low risk may be able to have less aggressive treatment and follow-up, whereas a person with higher-risk bladder cancer may require more aggressive treatment and more frequent follow-up."
1215#15#Constipation in infants and children ,"Fruit juice – Certain fruit juices can help to soften bowel movements. These include prune, apple, or pear (other juices are not as helpful). Do not give more than 4 to 6 ounces (120 to 180 mL) of 100 percent fruit juice per day to children between one and six years of age; children older than seven years may drink up to two 4-ounce (120 mL) servings per day.Fluids – It is not necessary to drink large amounts of fluid to treat constipation, although it is reasonable to be sure that the child drinks enough fluid. For children older than one year, enough fluid is defined as 32 ounces (960 mL) or more of water or other non-milk liquids per day. It is not necessary or helpful for the child to drink more than this if he or she is not thirsty.Food recommendations – Offer your child a well-balanced diet, including whole-grain foods, fruits, and vegetables (figure 2 and table 1). However, do not force these foods and do not use a high-fiber diet instead of other treatments (table 2A-B).Praise your child for trying these foods and encourage him or her to eat them frequently, but do not force these foods if your child is unwilling to eat them. You should offer a new food 8 to 10 times before giving up. You may want to avoid giving (or give smaller amounts of) certain foods while your child is constipated, including cow's milk, yogurt, cheese, and ice cream.A fiber supplement may be recommended for some children. Fiber supplements are available in several forms, including wafers, chewable tablets, or powdered fiber that can be mixed in juice (or frozen into popsicles).Milk – Some children develop constipation because they are unable to tolerate the protein in cow's milk. If other treatments for constipation are not helpful, try having the child avoid all cow's milk (and milk products) for at least two weeks. If your child's constipation does not improve during this time, you can begin giving cow's milk again. If you see blood in your child's bowel movement, check with your doctor or nurse.If the child does not drink milk for a long time, ask your child's doctor or nurse for suggestions about ways to be sure that he or she gets enough calcium and vitamin D."
3991#1#Antibiotic-associated diarrhea caused by Clostridioides difficile ,"Antibiotic-associated diarrhea refers to diarrhea that develops in a person who is taking or recently took antibiotics. One of the most serious causes of antibiotic-associated diarrhea is infection with a bacterium, Clostridioides difficile. C. difficile infections are common, with approximately 500,000 cases per year in the United States [1]. Infection is most common in people who are hospitalized, producing disease in more than 8 hospitalized patients per 1000 (0.9 percent) in 2008 in the United States [2].This topic review discusses the causes, symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment of C. difficile-associated diarrhea. Other types of diarrhea are discussed separately. (See  ""Patient education: Acute diarrhea in adults (Beyond the Basics)"" and  ""Patient education: Chronic diarrhea in adults (Beyond the Basics)"".)"
718#13#Bursitis ,"The medial collateral ligament (MCL) is located on the inner side of the knee, and connects the femur (thigh bone) to the tibia (shin bone) (figure 4). Bursitis in this area can cause pain and tenderness, but doesn't usually involve swelling. It must be differentiated from an injury or tear to the MCL or meniscus (the cartilage in the knee)."
2003#14#Constipation in adults ,"Laxatives are available as pills that you take by mouth or as suppositories or enemas that you insert into the rectum. In general, suppositories and enemas work more quickly compared to pills, but many people do not like using them.Healthcare providers occasionally recommend prepackaged enema kits containing sodium phosphate/biphosphate (Fleet) if you have not responded to other treatments. These are not recommended if you have problems with your heart or kidneys, and should not be used more than once unless directed by your healthcare provider."
699#19#Paget disease of bone (osteitis deformans) ,Synthetic calcitonin is a hormone that is given as an injection under the skin several times a week. Calcitonin may be recommended for people who are unable to tolerate the bisphosphonates because of kidney disease or intolerable side effects. Calcitonin can ease pain and is partially effective in reducing new bone growth.
1748#11#Type 2 diabetes and diet ,"A dietitian can help you figure out the number of carbohydrates you need each day based on your eating habits, weight, nutritional goals, and activity level. The way carbohydrates are divided up for each meal or snack will depend on your personal preferences, the timing and spacing of your meals, and which diabetes medications you take (table 1). ""Carb counting"" is particularly important if you take insulin, as you will need to adjust your insulin doses according to the carbohydrate content of what you are planning to eat. However, even if you do not take insulin, carb counting can help you keep your blood sugar levels from getting too low or too high.The number of carbohydrates in a particular food can be determined by reading the nutrition label, consulting a reference book, website, or smartphone app, or using the exchange system (see 'Exchange planning' below). If you are eating out, restaurants usually have this information available upon request. (See 'Where to get more information' below.)If you are calculating the carbohydrate content of a food, it is also important to note:The serving size – Eating more than one serving will increase the number of calories and carbohydrates consumed and the dose of insulin needed to cover the meal (if you take insulin). For example, some prepackaged snacks contain two or more servings. To calculate the carbohydrate content of the entire package, multiply the number of servings by the number of carbohydrates per serving.The fiber content – When a serving of food has more than 5 grams of fiber, subtract the grams of fiber from the grams of carbohydrates to calculate your insulin dose (figure 1). This is because fiber slows the body's absorption of carbohydrates, so less insulin is required to manage blood sugar levels."
3998#5#External otitis (including swimmer's ear) ,"Treatment of external otitis aims to reduce pain and eliminate the infection. Most people with external otitis can be treated at home. If your infection is severe or your eardrum is ruptured, you will be referred to an ear, nose, and throat specialist (an otolaryngologist) for an examination and treatment.In some cases, your health care provider will flush out your ear with water and hydrogen peroxide before you begin treatment; this speeds healing by removing dead skin cells and excess ear wax."
3994#12#Preventing infection in people with impaired spleen function ,"Animal bites and scratches, especially from dogs, can lead to serious and even fatal infection with a bacteria called Capnocytophaga canimorsus in people with impaired spleen function. If you are bitten or scratched by an animal, you should call your doctor. In most cases, you will be advised to take a dose of your emergency antibiotic supply and go to the nearest medical facility for evaluation. (See  ""Patient education: Animal and human bites (Beyond the Basics)"".)Ticks bites (particularly if you are in coastal New England, the mid-Atlantic states, or the Upper Midwest) can transmit an infection called babesiosis. Babesiosis is a parasitic infection that can be very severe in people whose spleen does not function well. If you get a tick bite, you should let your doctor know right away.Measures to avoid tick bites and steps to take after a tick bite are described in detail in a separate topic review. (See  ""Patient education: What to do after a tick bite to prevent Lyme disease (Beyond the Basics)"" and  ""Patient education: Lyme disease treatment (Beyond the Basics)"".)"
1201#2#Croup in infants and children ,"The most common cause of croup is a viral infection (such as parainfluenza or influenza) that leads to swelling of the larynx (voice box) and trachea (windpipe). However, infection with these viruses is common and most children with these infections do not develop croup.The viruses infect the nose and throat initially and then spread along the upper respiratory tract (back of the throat) to the larynx and trachea (windpipe) (figure 1). As the infection progresses, the bottom part of the larynx and top part of the trachea become swollen, which narrows the space available for air to enter the lungs (figure 2). This leads to the symptoms of croup. (See 'Croup symptoms' below.)Bacterial infection of the same areas can occur during the viral infection, but this does not happen very often. Bacterial coinfection is usually more severe and requires a different treatment than a viral infection."
1201#16#Croup in infants and children ,"Epinephrine, commonly referred to as ""adrenaline,"" is given by nebulizer (an inhaled mist) to children with moderate to severe croup. It also reduces swelling in the airway and begins to work faster than dexamethasone. It works for a short time period (two hours or less) and may be given every 15 to 20 minutes for severe symptoms. Retreatment may be needed after two hours if symptoms return after an initial response. When such ""rebound"" symptoms occur, it is usually within two to four hours after the treatment.Side effects of epinephrine include rapid heartbeat. Serious side effects are rare. Children who are given epinephrine must be monitored for three to four hours after the last dose to ensure that symptoms of airway blockage do not return."
8414#17#Vaginal hysterectomy ,"After surgery has begun, the surgeon may find conditions, such as extensive scar tissue, that require him or her to remove the uterus through abdominal incisions. Sometimes these conditions are not apparent before surgery.Abdominal hysterectomy can be done with a traditional incision or through very small incisions that allow insertion of an operative camera (laparoscope) to remove the uterus. Laparoscopic surgery may be done for women with a large uterus, prior pelvic surgery, concern for scar tissue from prior infections, or need for other procedures to be performed at the same time. The recovery from a total laparoscopic hysterectomy is similar to after a vaginal hysterectomy. Morcellation of the uterus (cutting the uterus into small pieces in the abdomen) may be done to help remove the uterus through the vaginal opening or through a small laparoscopy incision. This is usually done in a bag placed in the abdomen to prevent spread of uterine tissue in the abdomen. Patients should talk to their surgeon about the procedure."
719#7#Headache causes and diagnosis in adults ,"Medication-overuse headache may occur in people who have frequent migraine, cluster, or tension-type headaches, which leads them to overuse pain medications. A vicious cycle occurs in which frequent headaches cause the person to take medication frequently (often non-prescription medication), which then causes a rebound headache as the medication wears off, causing more medication use, and so on. Medication overuse headache can even occur if a person is taking daily analgesics to treat other areas of pain, as the body does not care why the person is taking the medication. This headache from frequent medication use is a result of the body's dependence on the medication.Overuse of any number of pain medications can increase the risk of developing medication-overuse headaches. To avoid medication-overuse headaches, we recommend the following:If possible, avoid medications that contain butalbital and opioids (narcotics) completely.Do not use triptans or aspirin/acetaminophen/caffeine combinations (sample brand name: Excedrin) more than nine days per month.Do not use nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) more than 14 days per month.More information about the different medications used to treat and prevent headaches is available separately. (See  ""Patient education: Headache treatment in adults (Beyond the Basics)"".)"
580#11#Sjögren's syndrome ,"In addition to the classic symptoms associated with Sjögren's syndrome (dry mouth and dry eyes), people with the disorder also have a higher risk of developing diseases of the lung (called interstitial pneumonitis), diseases of the kidneys (interstitial nephritis), and thyroid gland abnormalities. Some may develop inflammation of blood vessels (vasculitis). Vasculitis can cause a characteristic rash and can lead to skin, nerve, and/or internal organ damage. (See  ""Patient education: Vasculitis (Beyond the Basics)"".)Sjögren's syndrome also increases the risk of a cancer of the lymphatic system (most commonly non-Hodgkin lymphoma). The lymphatic system includes the tissues and organs that produce and store cells that fight infection, including the bone marrow, spleen, thymus, and lymph nodes. (See  ""Clinical manifestations of Sjögren's syndrome: Extraglandular disease"" and  ""Patient education: Diffuse large B cell lymphoma in adults (Beyond the Basics)"" and  ""Patient education: Follicular lymphoma in adults (Beyond the Basics)"".)The skin may be affected by dryness (xerosis) and various types of rashes, including small ""blood spots"" on the lower legs (purpura, stemming from inflammation of the blood vessels), vasculitis (particularly small vessel involvement), and red ring-like lesions with a central pale area (annular erythema).Neurologic involvement includes damage to peripheral nerves, leading to uncomfortable sensations in the skin and/or distal parts of the extremities, such as the hands and feet, including burning, numbness, or discomfort with light touch. Less common forms can lead to imbalance and poor coordination. Sjögren's syndrome can also affect the brain and spinal cord. The most common form of this involvement is demyelination (damage to the myelin, which is the material that covers and protects nerves), leading to symptoms and signs similar to what is seen in multiple sclerosis.Blood involvement can result in low red blood cell counts or anemia (sometimes leading to fatigue and shortness of breath), low white cell counts (sometimes leading to frequent infections), and low platelet counts (sometimes leading to bleeding)."
506#10#Arthritis and exercise ,"Strengthening exercises can help to improve joint stability and decrease pain. Examples of exercises that build strength include the use of free weights or weight machines. If you don't have access to a gym or weights, you can also build strength by doing ""body weight"" exercises (eg, modified squats to strengthen the knees).People with lax or malaligned knees should use caution with certain strengthening exercises because improving quadriceps strength (the muscles in the thighs) may speed the progression of preexisting arthritis. A physical therapist who specializes in treating arthritis-related knee problems can provide specific advice and can recommend exercises to balance strength building. Treatment may include modified exercises and appropriate bracing."
2171#11#Vitamin D deficiency ,"Testing for vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency is not recommended for everyone but may be advised for people who are home bound or in a long-term care facility (eg, nursing home) if the person has a medical condition that increases the risk of vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency; for anyone with osteoporosis or a past history of a low-trauma fracture (eg, fracture after fall from standing); or if a person has a low blood calcium or phosphate level. (See  ""Patient education: Bone density testing (Beyond the Basics)"" and  ""Patient education: Osteoporosis prevention and treatment (Beyond the Basics)"".)"
2169#10#Calcium and vitamin D for bone health ,"Vitamin D decreases bone loss and lowers the risk of fracture, especially in older men and women. Along with calcium, vitamin D also helps to prevent and treat osteoporosis. To absorb calcium efficiently, an adequate amount of vitamin D must be present.Vitamin D is normally made in the skin after exposure to sunlight. (See  ""Patient education: Vitamin D deficiency (Beyond the Basics)"".)"
3421#22#Syncope (fainting) ,"An electrophysiology study (EPS) may be performed if you have heart disease or if a rhythm problem is suspected. Susceptibility to abnormal rhythms can then be assessed under controlled, safe conditions.Most people undergo EPS in a hospital setting. You will be given a sedative before the procedure but may be awake during testing. The physician uses a local anesthetic to numb a small area over a blood vessel, usually in the groin, and then threads small wires through the blood vessels into the heart using x-ray (fluoroscopic) guidance. Once in the heart, precise measurements of the heart's electrical function can be obtained."
4866#4#Depression treatment options for adults ,"Individual medications are grouped into what health care providers call classes. All the medications within a particular class are chemically related and function in a similar way. The more commonly used medications are from the following classes:Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)Atypical antidepressantsSerotonin modulatorsOlder, less commonly used, antidepressants include:Tricyclic antidepressantsMonoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) – People taking MAOIs should avoid or limit certain foods, which can interact with the medication and cause serious health problems. Your health care provider can talk to you about which foods to avoid if you take an MAOI."
1175#1#Gastroesophageal reflux disease in children and adolescents ,"Gastroesophageal reflux, also called ""acid reflux,"" occurs when the stomach contents back up into the esophagus and/or mouth. Occasional reflux is normal and can happen in healthy infants, children, and adults, most often after eating a meal. Most episodes are brief and do not cause bothersome symptoms or problems.In contrast, the term gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) refers to bothersome symptoms or damage to the esophagus as a result of acid reflux. Symptoms of GERD can include heartburn, regurgitation, and difficulty or pain with swallowing. Asthma that is triggered by reflux is also considered a form of GERD. In rare instances, severe and longstanding GERD can result in a narrowing of the esophagus (stricture) or permanent tissue change (Barrett).This article discusses the symptoms, causes, diagnosis, and treatment of GERD in children and adolescents. Gastroesophageal reflux disease in infants and adults is discussed separately. (See  ""Patient education: Acid reflux (gastroesophageal reflux) in infants (Beyond the Basics)"" and  ""Patient education: Gastroesophageal reflux disease in adults (Beyond the Basics)"".)"
4648#3#Shortness of breath (dyspnea) ,"Acute shortness of breath usually happens along with other symptoms. The most common causes of acute shortness of breath include:Respiratory tract infections, such as bronchitis or pneumonia. These infections usually cause other symptoms, such as fever, cough, or coughing up sputum or mucus. (See  ""Patient education: Pneumonia in adults (Beyond the Basics)"".)A severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis), which usually also causes itching, swelling, a rash, or other symptoms. (See  ""Patient education: Anaphylaxis symptoms and diagnosis (Beyond the Basics)"".)Asthma, which often causes wheezing. (See  ""Patient education: Asthma treatment in adolescents and adults (Beyond the Basics)"" and  ""Patient education: Asthma treatment in children (Beyond the Basics)"".)A blockage in the respiratory tract, which could happen after accidentally inhaling a foreign object, such as a peanut or partially chewed meat.A blood clot or other blockage in an artery (blood vessel) in the lungs. (See  ""Patient education: Pulmonary embolism (Beyond the Basics)"".)A collapsed lung (pneumothorax). (See  ""Pneumothorax in adults: Epidemiology and etiology"".)Interruptions in blood flow to the heart muscle, which might happen during a heart attack. When this is the cause of shortness of breath, there are often other symptoms, such as pain or pressure in the chest. (See  ""Patient education: Heart attack (Beyond the Basics)"".)Heart failure, a condition that affects the heart's ability to pump blood throughout the body. (See  ""Patient education: Heart failure (Beyond the Basics)"".)Pregnancy changes a woman's hormones and consequently the circulatory and respiratory systems, even before the woman is visibly pregnant. This type of shortness of breath may last for several weeks but when it starts, it may seem like a sudden change. This is a normal change that happens during pregnancy.

681#8#Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) treatment in adults ,"Stem cell transplantation, also called bone marrow transplantation or hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), is a treatment in which you are given very high doses of chemotherapy or total body irradiation (TBI). This treatment is intended to kill cancer cells, but it also destroys all normal cells developing in the bone marrow. This means that your body's normal source of critical blood components (ie, the bone marrow) is no longer functional.Therefore, after this intensive treatment, you must receive a healthy supply of young blood cells (called stem cells) that are reintroduced, or transplanted using transfusion. The transplanted cells then re-establish the blood cell production process in the bone marrow. The new stem cells also generate a new immune system. (See  ""Patient education: Hematopoietic cell transplantation (bone marrow transplantation) (Beyond the Basics)"".)Stem cell transplantation is not recommended for all patients with AML. Serious, and sometimes even fatal, complications occur more commonly after donor stem cell transplantation than with chemotherapy. In certain groups of people, there is no clear benefit of stem cell transplantation over chemotherapy. However, transplantation may be appropriate in some people, such as those with more aggressive forms of AML, those who have had a relapse following a period of remission, and those who do not achieve complete remission after initial induction therapy.There are two main types of stem cell transplantation: allogeneic and autologous.Allogeneic transplantation is generally preferred over autologous transplantation in people with AML. It uses stem cells from a healthy donor, ideally a sibling with a similar genetic makeup (called a matched related donor). If you do not have a sibling with similar genetic characteristics, an unrelated person with a similar genetic makeup may be used (called a matched unrelated donor). Other possibilities include the use of a sibling with partially similar genetic characteristics or cord blood stem cells collected at birth from a newborn's umbilical cord.Allogeneic transplantation treats AML in two ways. First, high doses of chemotherapy or radiation are given immediately before the transplant, which kills the leukemia cells present in the blood and bone marrow that might be resistant to lower doses of chemotherapy. Second, when stem cells from another person are transfused, some of the donor stem cells mature into immune cells, and these donor immune cells can cause an immune response that helps destroy any remaining leukemia cells. This is called the ""graft-versus-leukemia"" or ""graft-versus-tumor"" effect. Unfortunately, this response is closely associated with a complication called ""graft-versus-host disease"" in which the immune response includes an attack on some of the patient's own healthy organs. Symptoms can include severe skin rash, diarrhea, liver damage, and other problems. In an autologous transplant, your own normal stem cells are collected while you are in complete remission. Shortly afterwards, high-dose chemotherapy or radiation is given. After your chemotherapy or radiation is complete, the harvested cells are returned by intravenous (IV) infusion.Because the transplanted stem cells do not come from another person, there is no ""graft-versus-host"" disease. This helps avoid most of the side effects of treatment. However, autologous transplantation is also somewhat less effective than allogeneic transplantation in fighting the leukemia, because of the lack of a ""graft-versus-leukemia"" effect. Autologous transplantation is less often recommended for treatment of AML for this reason."
1205#12#Colic (excessive crying) in infants ,"A number of devices (nipples, bottles) have been designed to decrease the amount of air swallowed during feeding. You may try positioning your infant in a vertical (sitting up) position while feeding. You may also try a curved bottle or collapsible bag, in combination with frequent burping. These techniques can reduce the amount of air swallowed, which may reduce colic in some infants.Some studies suggest that infants with colic improve when their formula is switched to a soy-based or hypoallergenic formula. However, the results of these studies are inconclusive. Consult with your infant's doctor or nurse to determine if a formula change might be helpful.Some doctors suggest a trial of a different formula for one week (for bottle-fed infants). The original formula should be restarted if there is no change; low allergy (hypoallergenic) and soy-based formulas are more expensive than traditional formula and do not need to be continued if crying does not improve after a one-week trial of the new formula."
4648#1#Shortness of breath (dyspnea) ,"Feeling short of breath can be an uncomfortable or frightening experience, especially if it has never happened to you before or occurs when doing activities that used to be easy for you. It can be caused by problems with the lungs or with the heart, or by a low blood count, but its specific cause can sometimes take a while to pinpoint. Luckily, most causes of shortness of breath can be treated quickly once the cause is identified.Many cases of shortness of breath are caused by simple, short lived problems, such as respiratory tract infections or allergies. The medical term for shortness of breath is dyspnea.This discussion will focus on the main causes of shortness of breath and tests that might be used to figure out the source of the problem. More information about shortness of breath is available by subscription. (See  ""Approach to the patient with dyspnea"".)"
1997#7#Acute pancreatitis ,"Acute pancreatitis can be caused by hereditary conditions, such as familial hypertriglyceridemia (high blood triglyceride levels) and hereditary pancreatitis. These conditions usually occur in children and young adults."
2002#2#Colonoscopy ,"The most common reasons for colonoscopy are:To screen for colon polyps (growths of tissue in the colon) or colon cancer Rectal bleedingA change in bowel habits, like persistent diarrheaIron deficiency anemia (a decrease in blood count due to loss of iron)A family history of colon cancerA personal history of colon polyps or colon cancer Chronic, unexplained abdominal or rectal painAn abnormal x-ray exam, like a barium enema or CT scan"
8404#11#Abdominal hysterectomy ,"Chronic pelvic pain can be due to the effects of endometriosis or scarring (adhesions) in the pelvis and between pelvic organs. However, pelvic pain can also be caused by other sources, including the gastrointestinal and urinary systems (see  ""Patient education: Chronic pelvic pain in women (Beyond the Basics)""). It is important for a woman with pelvic pain to ask about the probability that her pain will improve after hysterectomy."
8409#18#Genital warts in women ,"Getting rid of warts does not necessarily mean that the virus causing the warts (HPV) is gone. If warts come back, they usually do so within three to six months of treatment. This problem is more common in women with a weakened immune system (such as diabetes, HIV, or certain medications)."
7638#1#Eczema (atopic dermatitis) ,"Eczema, also known as atopic dermatitis, is a skin problem that causes dry, itchy, scaly, red skin. It can affect infants, children, and adults and seems more common in certain families. Eczema can be treated with moisturizers and prescription ointments."
3434#14#Stenting for the heart ,"After having a stent placed, seek immediate medical assistance if any of the following occur:Chest pain develops and is not relieved with one dose of sublingual (under the tongue) nitroglycerin.The puncture site becomes very painful, swollen, warm, bleeds more than a few drops, or drains pus.A fever higher than 100.4º F (38º C) develops."
3995#5#Giardia ,"Person-to-person transmission can happen when traces of infected feces travel between two people. This can happen if someone does not thoroughly wash their hands after using the bathroom or after changing the diapers of an infected child. Person-to-person transmission is the cause of outbreaks in families and institutions, such as daycare centers and nursing homes. Person-to-person transmission can also happen during anal sex.In addition to these three transmission routes, virtually all mammals can be infected with Giardia, and animal-to-person transmission may occur."
7627#32#Psoriasis ,"The role of dietary interventions in treating psoriasis has been unclear. Experts recommend that people with psoriasis who are overweight or obese reduce the number of calories they consume in order to try to lose weight. They also recommend a gluten-free diet for people with psoriasis who have been diagnosed with celiac disease or confirmed to have gluten sensitivity based on blood tests. Beyond this, there is no specific approach that has been proven to improve psoriasis symptoms; however, eating a nutritious, balanced diet (high in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains; and low in unhealthy fats and added sugar) has many other health benefits."
1745#1#Type 2 diabetes: Insulin treatment ,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a disorder that is known for disrupting the way your body uses glucose (sugar); it also causes other problems with the way your body stores and processes other forms of energy, including fat.All the cells in your body need glucose to work normally. Glucose gets into the cells with the help of a hormone called insulin. In type 2 diabetes, the body stops responding to normal or even high levels of insulin, and over time, the pancreas (an organ in the abdomen) does not make enough insulin to keep up with what the body needs. Being overweight, especially having extra fat stored in the liver and abdomen, increases the body's demand for insulin. This causes glucose to build up in the blood, which can lead to problems if untreated.People with type 2 diabetes require regular monitoring and ongoing treatment to maintain goal blood sugar levels and, equally importantly, to manage other conditions that go along with diabetes. Treatment includes lifestyle adjustments, self-care measures, and medications (which may or may not include insulin); combined, these approaches can help reduce the risk of complications. Learning to manage diabetes is a process that continues over a lifetime.This topic review discusses the role of insulin treatment in controlling blood sugar for people with type 2 diabetes. Separate topic reviews about other aspects of type 2 diabetes are also available. (See  ""Patient education: Type 2 diabetes: Overview (Beyond the Basics)"" and  ""Patient education: Blood glucose monitoring in diabetes (Beyond the Basics)"" and  ""Patient education: Hypoglycemia (low blood glucose) in people with diabetes (Beyond the Basics)"" and  ""Patient education: Type 2 diabetes: Alcohol, exercise, and medical care (Beyond the Basics)"" and  ""Patient education: Preventing complications from diabetes (Beyond the Basics)"" and  ""Patient education: Type 2 diabetes and diet (Beyond the Basics)"".)"
4576#2#Hepatitis C ,"Many people with hepatitis C infection do now know how they were infected. The hepatitis C virus is spread by contact with blood. The most common ways people have gotten infected are: Sharing needles, syringes, or other paraphernalia used for injection drug useReceiving a blood transfusion before 1990, when blood was not routinely tested for hepatitis C or other infectionsHaving sex with an infected person It is also possible to get the hepatitis C virus by:Getting body piercings or tattoos done with improperly sanitized equipment Sharing straws used for snorting cocaineSharing toothbrushes, razors, or other things that could have blood on themGetting stuck with a sharp object that has contaminated blood on it (as might happen in a health care setting)Pregnant women have about a 5 percent chance of passing the virus on to the developing baby.There is no evidence that any of the following activities lead to transmission of hepatitis C:Kissing or huggingSneezing or coughingCasual contact or other contact that does not involve bloodSharing food, water, eating utensils, or drinking glasses"
2014#25#Irritable bowel syndrome ,Lubiprostone (brand name: Amitiza) is available for treatment of severe constipation and IBS in women over 18 years who have not responded to other treatments. It works by increasing intestinal fluid secretion. It is expensive compared with other agents. Further testing is needed to clarify the effectiveness and long-term safety of lubiprostone.
4870#16#Depression treatment options for children and adolescents ,"During electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), an electrical current is passed through the brain, which in turn causes chemical changes that can relieve severe depression. While scientists do not yet fully understand exactly how ECT does this, they know it causes helpful changes to the molecules and cells of the brains of people with depression. ECT is especially effective for people with depression who also have delusions (powerful, irrational beliefs) and for people who have severe depression that has not responded to other treatments. The parent(s), patient, and psychiatrist must all agree to a trial of ECT before it is considered; state and local guidelines may also apply. (See  ""Medical evaluation for electroconvulsive therapy"".)Patients who undergo ECT are given general anesthesia to induce sleep and prevent discomfort. The patient is monitored carefully before, during, and after the treatment. Side effects of this therapy include brief confusion and memory loss. Although ECT has often been negatively portrayed in the media, it often provides rapid and dramatic relief of depression and has few side effects. Most people who undergo ECT find it a helpful treatment for their depression."
6736#4#Should I have a screening test for Down syndrome during pregnancy? ,"A screening test will tell you the chances of having a baby with a certain medical condition.Screening tests for Down syndrome cannot tell for certain whether your baby actually has Down syndrome; rather, they can tell you whether there is a low or high chance that the baby has this condition. By comparison, a diagnostic test can tell for certain if the baby has Down syndrome.These tests may also tell you if your pregnancy is at increased risk for certain other conditions. Some of these conditions are trisomy 18 and trisomy 13. These disorders are more life-threatening than Down syndrome.Screening tests only require a blood sample from the mother and possibly an ultrasound, so there is no increase in risk of losing the pregnancy. Diagnostic tests for Down syndrome and other chromosome problems require putting a needle into the uterus or placenta and removing some fluid or tissue. There is a small increase in risk of losing the pregnancy (approximately 1/200 for chorionic villus sampling [CVS] and 1/300 to 1/600 for amniocentesis).The decision to have a prenatal screening test for Down syndrome is yours and depends upon your wishes, values, and beliefs. There is no right or wrong choice. You can decide what is best for you and your family. Some couples who have a positive screening test decide against having a confirmatory diagnostic test. Others decide to continue the pregnancy even when Down syndrome is diagnosed. Testing can also be done after birth by doing a blood test on the baby."
4021#3#Acute diarrhea in adults ,"A person with diarrhea may be mildly to severely ill. A person who has mild illness may have a few loose bowel movements but otherwise feels well. By contrast, a person with severe diarrhea may have 20 or more bowel movements per day, happening up to every 20 or 30 minutes. In this situation, a significant amount of water and salts can be lost, seriously increasing the risk of dehydration. Diarrhea may be accompanied by fever (temperature greater than 100.4°F or 38°C), abdominal pain, or cramping."
2179#18#Hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid) ,"A health care provider will prescribe an initial dose of T4 and then retest the blood level of TSH after six weeks. The T4 dose can be adjusted at that time, depending upon these results. This process may be repeated several times before hormone levels become normal. After the optimal dose is identified, a provider may recommend monitoring blood tests once yearly, or more often as needed. Most people with hypothyroidism require lifelong treatment, although the dose of T4 may need to be adjusted over time.Never increase or decrease the T4 dose without first consulting a health care provider. Over-replacement of T4 can cause mild hyperthyroidism, with the associated dangers of atrial fibrillation (irregular heart beat) and, possibly, accelerated bone loss (osteoporosis)."
1190#11#High blood pressure in children ,Primary hypertension has no identifiable cause. It is the most common cause of hypertension in older children and adults.Primary hypertension is more likely in children who:Have completed pubertyHave a family history of hypertensionAre overweight or obese
700#2#Total hip replacement ,"Total hip replacement is only considered when you have tried and failed more conservative treatments, yet you continue to have significant pain, stiffness, or problems with the function of your hip.Total hip replacement may be performed on adults with a deteriorated hip. However, the replacement parts can break down over time, and healthcare providers generally recommend delaying hip replacement until it is absolutely necessary."
4021#14#Acute diarrhea in adults ,"Acute diarrhea is defined as three or more loose or watery stools per day.Diarrhea can be caused by infections or other factors. Sometimes, the cause of diarrhea is not known. Diarrhea caused by an infection usually begins 12 hours to four days after exposure and resolves within three to seven days.A person may have mild to severe diarrhea. Some people with diarrhea also have fever (temperature greater than 100.4°F or 38°C), abdominal pain, or cramping.People with mild diarrhea do not usually need to go to the doctor, especially if the diarrhea begins to improve within 48 hours. If you develop any of the following, you should call your doctor or nurse immediately:Profuse watery diarrhea with sluggishness, becoming tired easily, dry mouth and tongue, thirst, muscle cramps, dark-colored urine, urinating infrequently, and dizziness or lightheadedness after standing or sitting up. More severe features include abdominal pain, chest pain, confusion, or difficulty remaining alert.Passage of many small stools containing blood and mucusBloody or black diarrheaTemperature ≥38.5°C (101.3°F)Passing 6 or more watery stools per 24 hours or illness that lasts more than 48 hoursSevere abdominal painIn addition, if you have persistent diarrhea after finishing antibiotics, are older than 69, or have other medical illness or a weakened immune system, you should also consult your doctor or nurse.The most important treatment for diarrhea is to drink fluids that contain water, salt, and sugar, such as oral rehydration solution (ORS). Sports drinks (eg, Gatorade) may be acceptable if you are not dehydrated and are otherwise healthy. Diluted fruit juices and flavored soft drinks along with saltine crackers and broths or soups may also be acceptable.If you have dark yellow colored urine or do not pass urine frequently, you should drink more fluids. The urine should normally be light yellow to clear colored.Medications to reduce diarrhea are available without a prescription, and are safe if there is no fever (temperature greater than 100.4°F or 38°C) and the stools are not bloody. These medications do not cure the cause of the diarrhea, but help to reduce the frequency of bowel movements. Common medications include loperamide (Imodium®), diphenoxylate-atropine (Lomotil®), and bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol® or Kaopectate®).If you do not have an appetite, you can drink only liquids for a short period of time. Boiled starches and cereals (eg, potatoes, noodles, rice, wheat, and oat) with salt are recommended if you have watery diarrhea; crackers, bananas, soup, and boiled vegetables may also be eaten.Antibiotics are not needed for most people with diarrhea.If you have diarrhea, be careful to avoid spreading the infection to family, friends, and co-workers. You are contagious for as long as diarrhea continues. Infections are usually spread from hand to mouth; hand washing, care with diapering, and staying out of work or school are a few ways to prevent infecting family and other contacts."
1216#30#Vaccines for infants and children age 0 to 6 years ,The first dose of MMR is given at 12 to 15 months of age. A second dose is recommended routinely before school entry (between 4 and 6 years of age). The recommended schedule is available through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Children living in or traveling to areas where there is a measles outbreak (defined as ≥3 cases linked in time and space) and children traveling outside the United States should receive MMR vaccine earlier than it is routinely recommended.
4412#4#Blood in the urine (hematuria) in adults ,"There are a number of tests available to determine the cause of hematuria. Most people do not need every single test. Urine tests – Urine tests can provide clues about the cause of hematuria. This may include a urinalysis, which is performed with a dipstick test and sometimes uses a microscope to analyze the contents of the urine. Another test that may be performed is a urine cytology, which uses a microscope to analyze cells from the lining of the bladder and kidney (found in the urine).Blood tests – Blood tests may be used to look for evidence of kidney or other diseases that can cause hematuria.CT scan – Computed tomography, or CT scan, is a radiologic test that examines the structure of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder. Kidney stones or abnormalities of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder can usually be seen with a CT scan. A dye is usually injected into a vein during the test, which highlights any possible abnormalities.Kidney ultrasound – An ultrasound of the kidney is an alternative to CT scan and is preferred for people who are allergic to the dye used in CT. Ultrasound uses sound waves to create a picture of the kidney's structure.Cystoscopy – Cystoscopy is a procedure that is most often done in an office setting but sometimes is done as a day surgery procedure. A small tube with a camera is inserted into the bladder through the urethra (figure 1). A numbing gel is applied before the tube is inserted to decrease discomfort. The vast majority of patients tolerate this 5 to 10 minute procedure very well.During cystoscopy, the clinician examines the lining of the bladder to determine whether there are any abnormalities. If abnormal tissue is seen, a biopsy can be taken. The biopsy is examined with a microscope to determine whether abnormal or cancerous cells are present.Kidney biopsy – During a kidney (renal) biopsy, a clinician removes a small piece of tissue from the kidney; the tissue is later examined with a microscope for signs of kidney disease. A full description of renal biopsy is available separately. (See  ""Patient education: Kidney (renal) biopsy (Beyond the Basics)"".)"
4866#2#Depression treatment options for adults ,"When people talk about depression, they’re usually referring to what health care providers call “unipolar major depression” (or major depressive disorder). The diagnosis of unipolar major depression is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See  ""Patient education: Depression in adults (Beyond the Basics)"".)Briefly, to be diagnosed with unipolar major depression, a person must have five or more of the following symptoms present most of the day nearly every day for at least two weeks in a row. For the diagnosis, at least one symptom must be either depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure.Depressed moodLoss of interest or pleasure in most or all activitiesChange in appetite or weightInsomnia or hypersomnia (sleeping too little or too much)Psychomotor agitation or retardation (restlessness or sluggishness)Fatigue or loss of energyFeelings of worthlessness or excessive guiltPoor concentrationRecurrent thoughts of death or suicideFor the purposes of this discussion, we will use depression to mean unipolar major depression. There are other subtypes of depression, as well, but those are beyond the scope of this article."
8395#10#Common breast problems ,"Having a milky-colored discharge (also called galactorrhea) from both nipples is common, especially during the first year or two after giving birth. Nipple discharge from both breasts can also occur in women with an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism), as a side effect of certain medications, or because of a growth in the pituitary (a part of the brain), causing an increase in a hormone called prolactin. (See  ""Patient education: Hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid) (Beyond the Basics)"" and  ""Patient education: High prolactin levels and prolactinomas (Beyond the Basics)"".)As with other ducts in the body, breast ducts make and carry secretions. Many women can express (squeeze out) a small amount of yellowish, greenish, or brownish discharge. This is often called ""physiologic"" discharge and is not a cause for concern. Physiologic discharge is not bloody.Spontaneous nipple discharge (discharge that occurs without squeezing) or nipple discharge that is clear (not yellow or straw-colored) or bloody may be caused by an abnormal growth within the breast or, less commonly, by breast cancer.Any woman with nipple discharge should be evaluated by a healthcare provider. A mammogram, breast ultrasound, breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, and/or exam of the breast ducts (ductogram, also called galactogram) may be recommended in some cases. (See  ""Nipple discharge"".)"
1990#12#Diet and health ,"Eat lots of vegetables, fruits, and whole grains and a limited amount of red meat. Get at least five servings of fruits and vegetables every day. Tips for achieving this goal include:Make fruits and vegetables part of every meal. Eat a variety of fruits and vegetables. Frozen or canned can be used when fresh isn't convenient.Eat vegetables as snacks.Have a bowl of fruit out all the time for kids to take snacks from.Put fruit on your cereal.Consume at least half of all grains as whole grains (like 100 percent whole wheat bread, brown rice, whole grain cereal), replacing refined grains (like white bread, white rice, refined or sweetened cereals).Choose smaller portions and eat more slowly.Cut down on unhealthy fats (trans fats and saturated fats) and consume more healthy fats (polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fat). Tips for achieving this goal include:Choose chicken, fish, and beans instead of red meat and cheese.Cook with oils that contain polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats, like corn, olive, and peanut oil.Choose margarines that do not have partially hydrogenated oils. Soft margarines (especially squeeze margarines) have less trans fatty acids than stick margarines.Eat fewer baked goods that are store-made and contain partially hydrogenated fats (like many types of crackers, cookies, and cupcakes).When eating at fast food restaurants, choose healthy items for yourself as well as your family, like broiled chicken or salad.If choosing prepared or processed foods, choose those labeled “zero trans fat.” They may still have some trans fat but likely less than similar choices not labeled “zero.”Avoid sugary drinks and excessive alcohol intake. Tips for achieving this goal include:Choose non-sweetened and non-alcoholic beverages, like water, at meals and parties.Avoid occasions centered around alcohol.Avoid making sugary drinks and alcohol an essential part of family gatherings.Keep calorie intake balanced with needs and activity level. (See  ""Patient education: Exercise (Beyond the Basics)"".)"
88574#6#Oral allergy syndrome ,"In most cases, simply avoiding the foods that cause symptoms, in their raw forms, is sufficient treatment. This might involve avoiding dried or dehydrated forms of the foods, since dried foods are not usually cooked and can still cause symptoms. Sometimes, peeling a fruit (because much of the allergen is in the skin) or microwaving it for at least 10 seconds will destroy enough of the allergen that the fruit does not cause symptoms anymore, but this does not work for everyone or for all foods. As mentioned before, both raw and roasted nuts can cause OAS, and reactions to nuts should be treated with caution and discussed with a health care provider. There is no reason to avoid cooked, baked, canned, or processed forms of the foods that do not cause symptoms. An exception are soy beverages (""soy milks"") that are associated with higher risk of systemic reaction in individuals with OAS to soy and should be avoided.Usually, OAS symptoms affecting the mouth and throat are mild, resolve quickly, and do not need treatment. However, more severe symptoms may occur rarely. If you have ever experienced allergic symptoms other than mild mouth or throat symptoms, such as chest tightness, difficulty breathing, nausea, severe throat discomfort (swelling, difficulty swallowing, drooling, hoarse voice), vomiting, diarrhea, or loss of consciousness, then you may need to carry an epinephrine autoinjector (Epi-Pen or similar device) for injecting epinephrine. Epinephrine is the best treatment for a severe allergic reaction [3]. Epinephrine autoinjectors are discussed in more detail elsewhere. (See  ""Patient education: Using an epinephrine autoinjector (Beyond the Basics)"" and  ""Patient education: Epinephrine autoinjectors (The Basics)"".)"
8418#14#Infertility treatment with gonadotropins ,"Ovarian stimulation using gonadotropins combined with intrauterine insemination (IUI) has a higher rate of success in most cases. However, more than one cycle of treatment is often necessary before pregnancy occurs. Some women will not become pregnant despite multiple attempts. Depending upon the situation, the next step may be to consider in vitro fertilization (IVF). (See  ""Patient education: In vitro fertilization (IVF) (Beyond the Basics)"".)It can be difficult to deal with the emotional highs and lows of infertility treatment. This is especially true if the woman (and her partner) have been trying to conceive for a long time, if treatment is not covered by insurance, and if there are any underlying problems in the couple's life (eg, medical, family or partner, job, financial).Support groups and counseling services are available at many infertility treatment centers, as well as on the internet (see 'Where to get more information' below). To find a reputable group, talk to your health care provider."
519#17#Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) ,"Most clinicians recommend stopping all NSAIDs approximately one week before elective surgery to decrease the risk of excessive bleeding. This usually includes aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, and most prescription NSAIDs. Specific instructions regarding NSAIDs and surgery should be discussed with the surgeon and with the clinician who prescribed the NSAID."
580#17#Sjögren's syndrome ,People with Sjögren's syndrome are at increased risk for dental cavities. You should brush and floss after eating meals and snacks. It is important for you to visit your dentist at least every six months for a cleaning and evaluation.Toothpastes designed specifically for people with dry mouth are available. These lack the detergents that are present in many types of toothpaste but can irritate a dry mouth. Toothbrushes with special features that help clean between the teeth (including electric toothbrushes) may also help to keep your teeth clean.Toothpaste with fluoride (or a special fluoride rinse or varnish) may help to prevent cavities. A fluoride treatment after each dental cleaning may also be helpful.
2172#3#Bone density testing ,"Factors that increase a person's risk of fracture and may lead to earlier bone density testing include:Cigarette smokingLong-term use of steroid (glucocorticoid) medications such as prednisoneLow body weight (less than 127 lbs or 58 kg)Rheumatoid arthritisHistory of a nontraumatic or low trauma bone fracture in self or parents (eg, breaking a bone after falling from standing height or less)Excessive alcohol consumption (three or more servings a day)A disorder strongly associated with osteoporosis, such as diabetes, untreated hyperthyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, early menopause, chronic malnutrition or malabsorption, or chronic liver disease"
3446#4#Heart failure ,"Heart failure is caused by a disease or condition that damages the heart. Fortunately, treating these conditions during the early stages can often prevent or slow the development of heart failure. The most common causes of heart failure include:"
518#10#Reactive arthritis ,"Most people with reactive arthritis have a mild course of joint pain that resolves spontaneously and that never comes back. In some people, the disease will intermittently cause symptoms. In others, the disease is persistent.If your back becomes painful and stiff and does not improve with time, reactive arthritis may have developed into axial spondyloarthritis. (See  ""Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of peripheral spondyloarthritis in adults"" and  ""Patient education: Axial spondyloarthritis, including ankylosing spondylitis (Beyond the Basics)"".)"
1187#8#Meningitis in children ,"Bacterial meningitis is a life-threatening illness that requires hospitalization and treatment with intravenous antibiotics. The child will be monitored closely for signs of complications. Depending upon the severity of the illness, the child may also need supportive treatments to aid breathing, maintain blood pressure, prevent excessive bleeding, and stay hydrated."
"4415#14#High blood pressure, diet, and weight ","Regular exercise can lower your blood pressure even if you don't lose weight. Recommendations from the American Heart Association suggest that to achieve substantial health benefits requires 150 to 300 minutes per week of moderate-intensity aerobic activity (such as brisk walking) or 75 to 150 minutes per week of vigorous intensity aerobic activity (such as jogging) plus muscle-strengthening exercises (resistance training) involving all major muscle groups at least twice per week [3]. Isometric exercises (eg, repeated handgrip contraction) may also be of benefit. Exercise will not only help lower blood pressure but also improves cholesterol levels. However, to maintain this benefit, you must continue to exercise regularly. Although this level of exercise is recommended to get substantial reductions in blood pressure (4 to 5 mmHg systolic), any amount of physical activity is better than none. Even gentle forms of exercise, like walking, have health benefits. (See  ""Patient education: Exercise (Beyond the Basics)"".)"
718#6#Bursitis ,"Shoulder bursitis causes pain in the shoulder and often extends to the upper arm (figure 1). Pain is often present at rest but increases with movement of the arm, especially with lifting the arms above the head; it also often interrupts sleep. It can be difficult to differentiate shoulder bursitis from other issues such as a rotator cuff tendinitis, rotator cuff tear, shoulder arthritis, or labral tear."
732#12#Delirium ,"The goal of supportive care is to maintain the patient's health, prevent additional complications, and avoid those factors that can aggravate delirium. This includes:Making sure the person gets enough to eat and drink (or providing nutrition through an IV, if needed)Treating pain and avoiding discomfort, including avoiding constipation (see  ""Patient education: Constipation in adults (Beyond the Basics)"")Minimizing the use of restraints and bladder catheters, which can be uncomfortable, particularly to confused patientsEncouraging movement (getting out of bed in order to walk) with necessary assistance to avoid fallsHaving someone help during meals and having the person sit upright to minimize the risk of inhaling food, drinks, and/or saliva, which can lead to pneumoniaMaintaining a regular night-day/sleep-wake cycle when possible and avoiding sleep deprivation, and maintaining a reassuring and familiar environment with one or two visiting family members or familiar objects/pictures from homeAvoiding overstimulation (eg, multiple visitors, loud noise), which can worsen delirium, but also avoiding understimulation (darkened room, complete silence)Making hearing aids and eyeglasses available at the hospital if the patient uses these at home"
574#7#Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) ,"If a diagnosis of Sjögren's syndrome is suspected, the health care provider may test for autoantibodies directed against antigens known as Ro/SSA and La/SSB. The presence of these autoantibodies provides support for the diagnosis of Sjögren's syndrome, a disorder which involves autoimmune destruction of the glands that produce tears and saliva."
3435#3#Cardioversion ,"During a rapid cardiac arrhythmia, an abnormal fast electrical mechanism overrides the action of the sinus node. There are a wide variety of cardiac arrhythmias, some of which start in the atria and some in the ventricles.In a normal heart rhythm, the electrical impulse moves from the top to the bottom of the heart, then dissipates. The next impulse begins independently in the sinus node (figure 2). Sometimes, cardiac tissue can form an electrical loop or short-circuit. If an electrical impulse enters this loop at the right time under the right conditions, it will cycle through the loop over and over again, repeating itself indefinitely. This is called a re-entrant loop. Each time the impulse cycles through the re-entrant circuit, it activates the heart, causing another contraction.Arrhythmias that are generated by a re-entrant circuit are often regular and organized and can be treated with cardioversion. Examples of a single reentrant circuit include atrial flutter and ventricular tachycardia (VT). Under some circumstances, multiple reentrant circuits can develop, resulting in very rapid and chaotic arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation. "
2013#6#Hemorrhoids ,"To diagnose hemorrhoids, your clinician will examine your rectum and anus, and may insert a gloved finger into the rectum. If there is bleeding, testing should include a procedure that allows your healthcare provider to look inside the anus (called anoscopy) or colon (sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy). (See  ""Patient education: Flexible sigmoidoscopy (Beyond the Basics)"".)"
884#4#Breast cancer screening ,"If your mammogram is abnormal, you will likely need further testing. In fact, in the United States, about 1 in every 10 people who are screened will have an abnormal mammogram requiring follow-up. Most often when this happens, you will need to have more images taken (either mammogram or ultrasound images). Needing more images is common and does not usually mean that you have cancer. Knowing that this is common may help to reduce your anxiety if this happens to you. The extra images help the radiologist to have the most accurate and clear view of your breast tissue. Occasionally, additional testing such as a breast biopsy (in which a small amount of tissue is removed for examination) is needed to follow up on an abnormal screening mammogram result.Follow-up testing after an abnormal mammogram is discussed in more detail separately. (See  ""Patient education: Common breast problems (Beyond the Basics)"", section on 'Abnormal mammogram'.)"
6725#11#Postterm pregnancy ,"Nonstress testing is done by monitoring the baby's heart rate with a small device that is placed on the mother's abdomen. The device uses sound waves (ultrasound) to measure changes in the baby's heart rate over time, usually over a period of 20 to 30 minutes. Normally, the baby's baseline heart rate should be between 110 and 160 beats per minute and should increase above its baseline by at least 15 beats per minute for 15 seconds several times during the test.The test is considered reassuring (called ""reactive"") if two or more fetal heart rate increases (called ""accelerations"") are seen within a 20 minute period. Further testing may be needed if these increases are not observed after monitoring for 40 minutes."
860#7#Colorectal cancer treatment; metastatic cancer ,"Other drugs that are active against metastatic colorectal cancer work by a different mechanism. These are referred to as ""targeted therapy agents"" since they are either antibodies (a type of protein) or drugs that work to inhibit specific proteins that are important for the growth and/or survival of colon cancer cells.Because targeted therapy agents do not directly interfere with rapidly dividing cells, they do not have the usual side effects of conventional chemotherapy. However, targeted chemotherapy has other unique side effects, which are described in detail below. (See 'Colorectal cancer chemotherapy side effects' below.)Currently available targeted chemotherapy agents include:Bevacizumab (brand name: Avastin) – Bevacizumab binds to a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). VEGF is involved in the development of a blood supply within a growing cancer; this blood supply is essential for the tumor to grow and spread. Bevacizumab enhances the antitumor effect of other chemotherapy drugs. Bevacizumab is not effective when given by itself, but is generally given in combination with other drugs, such as FU (or capecitabine), oxaliplatin, and irinotecan (see below).Ramucirumab (brand name: Cyramza) – Ramucirumab is a protein that binds to a receptor for VEGF (VEGFR2), thus targeting signaling through the same pathway that bevacizumab does. Like bevacizumab, ramucirumab enhances the antitumor effect of other chemotherapy drugs. In the United States, it is approved in combination with an irinotecan-based chemotherapy regimen for patients who have previously been treated with bevacizumab plus an oxaliplatin-containing regimen.Aflibercept (brand name: Zaltrap) – Intravenous aflibercept represents another method of interfering with a tumor's blood supply; it is a fusion protein that acts by ""trapping"" VEGF and preventing it from activating its receptors on the tumor cells. In the United States, aflibercept is approved, in combination with irinotecan-based chemotherapy, for patients whose tumors have progressed while receiving an oxaliplatin-containing chemotherapy regimen, with or without bevacizumab.Regorafenib (brand name: Stivarga) – Regorafenib is a pill form of a drug that blocks several VEGF receptors as well as other proteins referred to as kinases. In the United States, regorafenib is approved as a single agent for the treatment of patients who have been previously treated with fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin-, and irinotecan-containing chemotherapy regimens as well as other targeted therapies.Cetuximab (brand name: Erbitux) and panitumumab (brand name: Vectibix) – Cetuximab and panitumumab target a different protein, the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR).Unlike bevacizumab, cetuximab and panitumumab are active when given alone or in combination with other drugs, like irinotecan.However, these agents do not work for everyone. Their activity depends on whether or not the tumor has specific genetic abnormalities (a mutation in a set of genes called RAS genes or in a separate gene called BRAF V600E).If the tumor does not have a RAS or a BRAF V600E mutation, cetuximab and panitumumab might work (ie, they can be effective).If the tumor has a RAS or a BRAF V600E mutation, cetuximab and panitumumab do not work, even in combinations with standard chemotherapy agents.If the tumor has a BRAF but not a RAS mutation, cetuximab and panitumumab might work in combination with other drugs that target the BRAF mutation and related molecules.Larotrectinib (brand name: Vitrakvi) and entrectinib (brand name: Rozlytrek) are drugs called tropomyosin receptor kinase (TRK) inhibitors. They target a specific protein that is present in large amounts in people whose cancer has an abnormality resulting from two genes fusing together (called ""TRK fusion-positive tumors"")."
2175#22#Evaluation of infertility in couples ,"Dealing with infertility can be very stressful for a couple. Either of both partners may struggle with feelings of sadness, anxiety, anger, or guilt. Some people find it helpful to talk with a counselor or attend a support group with other people who are also dealing with infertility.If you or your partner is struggling with anxiety or depression, talk to a health care provider. There are treatments that can help."
3448#14#Pacemakers ,"People who have a permanent pacemaker will require periodic surveillance of the implanted device. The status of the pacemaker will be regularly checked or ""interrogated"" (often done remotely using a telephone or a secure web-based system) to provide information regarding the type of heart rhythm, the functioning of the pacemaker leads, the frequency of utilization of the pacemaker, the battery life, and the presence of any abnormal heart rhythms.All contemporary devices are programmable with information and settings that can be altered and stored. Information is obtained by transmitting data from the pulse generator to a programmer, usually done during a follow-up office visit. However, with newer pulse generators it may be possible to obtain information about the pacemaker's performance by downloading data from the patient's device to the internet and then to the caregiver's office. In older devices, pacemaker status can be checked routinely via the telephone using a trans-telephonic device.The pulse generators are usually powered by lithium batteries that function for an average of five to eight years before they need to be replaced. When the batteries start to wear out, they do so in a very slow and predictable fashion, allowing sufficient time to be detected and pulse-generator replacement planned. Replacing the pulse generator usually requires a simple procedure in which a skin incision is made over the old incision, the old generator is removed, and a new generator is implanted and joined with the existing leads, assuming the existing leads are functioning normally.The pacemaker leads are usually used indefinitely, unless a specific problem occurs (eg, the lead loses contact with the heart, the lead breaks, or the lead is not functioning properly). In such circumstances, the lead may require replacement. Often, the old lead is left in place but disconnected from the pulse generator and capped, and a new lead is inserted. Removal of an old lead is feasible but difficult in most cases, because of the formation of scar tissue binding the lead to the blood vessels and heart muscle. Lead removal is usually necessary if the system becomes infected."
7959#6#Foodborne illness (food poisoning) ,"Certain Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria can cause foodborne illness, particularly an illness known as ""traveler's diarrhea."" Infection with E. coli can occur when food or water becomes contaminated with infected feces. Some types of E. coli infection can be very serious, resulting in kidney failure or worse."
859#12#Cervical cancer treatment; early-stage cancer ,"Most women and families affected by cervical cancer worry about their short- and long-term health and the risk of the cancer coming back. You might continue to worry for many years after treatment ends.It is important to talk openly and honestly with your family and health care team. Many women benefit from bringing a family member or friend to doctor visits; this person can help you to understand your options, ask important questions, take notes, and feel supported.A variety of support options are available, both during and after treatment, including individual counseling, support groups, and Internet-based discussion groups. A list of reputable groups is available below. (See 'Where to get more information' below.)"
3695#8#Symptoms of HIV ,"If HIV is not treated, the virus will cause progressive weakening of the immune system, a process which occurs at different rates in different people. Once significant damage to the immune system has occurred, which typically takes at least several years, people with HIV can develop infections that are not usually seen in people with normal immunity. These “opportunistic infections” can cause serious disease in patients with advanced HIV. Depending on the opportunistic infection, symptoms may include shortness of breath, blurred vision, fevers, and weight loss.One of the most common opportunistic infections is yeast infection of the mouth or esophagus. Yeast infections are caused by Candida, a fungal organism that is normally found on the skin and in the mouth, intestinal tract, and vagina in healthy individuals. Certain yeast infections can occur in people without HIV, (eg, vaginal yeast infections) although people with HIV are at a higher risk for this and other types of opportunistic infections. (See  ""Patient education: Vaginal yeast infection (Beyond the Basics)"".)Candidiasis of the mouth, also known as thrush, causes cream-colored, slightly raised patches in the mouth, soreness, and easy bleedingCandidiasis of the esophagus may cause difficulty swallowingHowever, with diagnosis and treatment of HIV, the immune system can improve. Then the risk of opportunistic infections goes down. While the immune system is recovering, certain medications can help prevent any opportunistic infections from occurring in the first place."
6728#11#C-section (cesarean delivery) ,"The woman is usually accompanied to an operating room before anesthesia is administered. A partner can usually stay with the woman in the operating room.There are two types of anesthesia used during cesarean delivery: regional and less commonly, general. For a planned cesarean delivery, regional anesthesia is usually performed. Meeting with the anesthesiologist allows the woman to ask specific questions about anesthesia, and allows the anesthesiologist to identify any medical problems that might affect the type of anesthesia that is recommended.With epidural and spinal regional anesthesia, the anesthetic is injected near the spine, which numbs the abdomen and legs to allow the surgery to be pain-free while allowing the mother to be awake.General anesthesia, now infrequently used for cesarean, induces unconsciousness. This means that the mother will not be awake or aware during the procedure. After the anesthesia is given, the woman will fall asleep within 10 to 20 seconds and a tube will be placed in the throat to assist with breathing. General anesthesia carries a greater risk of complications than epidural or regional anesthesia because of the need for an endotracheal (breathing) tube and because drugs given to the mother affect the infant.Women who have general anesthesia will not be awake during the cesarean delivery. Regional anesthesia is generally preferred because it allows the mother to remain awake during the procedure, enjoy support from staff and her partner, experience the birth, and have immediate contact with the infant. It is usually safer than general anesthesia.After the anesthesia is given, a catheter is placed in the bladder to allow urine to drain out during the surgery and reduce the chance of injury to the bladder. The catheter is usually removed within 24 hours after the procedure."
2019#11#Colon polyps ,"Colorectal cancer is preventable if precancerous polyps (ie, adenomas) are detected and removed before they become malignant (cancerous). Over time, small polyps can change their structure and become cancerous. Polyps are usually removed when they are found on colonoscopy, which eliminates the chance for that polyp to become cancerous."
508#4#Complementary and alternative therapies for rheumatoid arthritis ,"Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapies might sometimes be used alongside conventional medical treatment. They are not meant to replace conventional rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatment, but may help to alleviate side effects or to improve a patient's sense of wellbeing.CAM therapies are attractive because they are perceived to be safe and ""natural"" and because conventional medical treatments can have limited effectiveness and significant side effects. However, it is not clear how most CAM treatments work. Many are marketed with unproven claims, and certain therapies have even been proven to be harmful. Moreover, in many countries, including the United States, these products are not regulated by government agencies the way standard medicines are. Some contain potentially harmful ingredients, and some are expensive.Several CAM therapies may play a role in the treatment of RA, although the safety and effectiveness of most of these therapies are still uncertain. Thus, people with RA who are considering CAM therapies should discuss those therapies with their health care provider first. Furthermore, therapies that have proven benefits should only be used adjunctively, not to replace, conventional medical treatment."
4418#6#Dialysis or kidney transplantation — which is right for me? ,"In hemodialysis, your blood is pumped through a dialysis machine to remove waste products and excess fluids. You are connected to the dialysis machine using a surgically created path called a vascular access, also known as a fistula or graft. Sometimes, a catheter inserted into a large vein in the neck is used for hemodialysis treatments, although it is better to have a fistula or graft. This allows blood to be removed from the body, circulate through the dialysis machine, and then return to the body.Hemodialysis can be done at a dialysis center or at home. When done in a center, it is most commonly done three times a week and takes between three and five hours per session. In-center hemodialysis can also be done with an overnight treatment three times per week. Home dialysis is generally done three to six times per week and takes between 3 and 10 hours per session (sometimes while sleeping). More detailed information about hemodialysis is available separately. (See  ""Patient education: Hemodialysis (Beyond the Basics)"".)"
883#17#Prostate cancer screening ,Screening discussions should begin at age 50 years for men at average risk for developing prostate cancer. Men with risk factors for prostate cancer (such as black men or men with a father or brother who had prostate cancer) may want to begin screening discussions at age 40 to 45 years.
4414#13#Hemodialysis ,"Dialysis may be done in a hospital, a clinic associated with a hospital, or a freestanding clinic. Centers are staffed with physicians, nurses, and patient-care technicians, all of whom participate in your care. In general, in-center hemodialysis takes between three and five hours (the average is three-and-a-half to four hours) and is done three times a week. You will be able to read or sleep during treatment, and you usually have access to a television. Eating, drinking, and visitors are usually restricted in a dialysis center.Hemodialysis can also be done at night (called nocturnal hemodialysis) in a dialysis center, typically three times weekly while you are sleeping in the center. As with home nocturnal hemodialysis, additional time is needed to prepare and clean up. Nocturnal hemodialysis also seems to provide substantial benefits compared with conventional in-center, three times weekly hemodialysis treatments that are three to four hours in duration. These longer dialysis treatments can result in a significant improvement in your well-being, reduce symptoms during and between dialyses, and improve quality of life."
16279#3#Coping with high drug prices ,"Get started by finding out what options you have for lowering your cost and confirming that you need all of the medicines you have been prescribed. You will need to have a discussion with your doctor about this. Here are a few things you should do first to be prepared:First: Create a list of all of the medicines you take, how you take them, and how much you pay for each prescription every month. Your pharmacy can help you prepare this list and may be able to print one for you.Create a medication list – An example of a list you can use to keep track of your medicines can be found at www.fda.gov/drugs/resources-you-drugs/my-medicine-record.You should also include on your list any non-prescription (over-the-counter) medicines you take, including any vitamins or herbal supplements.Ask about lower-cost alternatives – For any medicines that have a high cost, ask your pharmacist if there is a low-cost generic that works in the same way. Have the pharmacist write down the names of these alternatives on your list; then you can review these with your doctor to find out if changing to a lower-cost drug makes sense for you.Next: If you have prescription drug coverage through your health insurance, get the list of drugs that have the best coverage from your insurance company. You can do this by calling them or printing it off of their website. This is usually called the “Tier 1” or ""preferred"" drug list. Then you can:Ask your insurance company about lower-cost alternatives – For each medicine that has a high cost, ask your insurance company for the name of a medicine that works in the same way but has better coverage so you can ask your doctor about switching to it.Even if you do not have prescription coverage, you can lower your cost by switching to generic medicines and shopping around for the best prices.Shop around and find the lowest prices – Some big retail and club stores have programs that can get you prices as low as USD $4 per month on many generic medicines. You can get these lower prices if you have no drug coverage or by not using your drug coverage. Find one or two of these in your area and ask for a list of medicines that are available through this program. There is more information about finding the lowest drug prices later in this article. (See 'Comparing prices' below.)Once you collect the above information, you will be ready to have a discussion with your doctor or other health care provider. Then, they can prescribe lower-cost medicines for you if appropriate.If you go to a large health system or hospital for your care, there may be a social worker or pharmacist available to help you collect information about lower-cost alternatives and savings programs. Ask the nurse or pharmacist if there is help available."
4421#8#Kidney (renal) biopsy ,"The biopsy needle can rarely injure the walls of a nearby artery and vein, and this can lead to the development of a fistula (a connection between the two blood vessels). Fistulas generally do not cause problems and usually close on their own over time."
3445#10#Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy ,"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the heart (also known as cardiovascular magnetic resonance, CMR) can detect thickening of the left ventricular wall, including portions of the wall than can be difficult to assess by echocardiography. This test may also be helpful in detecting other abnormalities in people with HCM such as leaking of the mitral valve (mitral regurgitation) and scarring of the heart muscle."
1205#20#Colic (excessive crying) in infants ,"Colic can take a toll on families. Some researchers have suggested that colic interferes with child-parent interactions and can have a long-term effect on the family and child.Long-term studies have examined the possible relationships between colic and later childhood, including temperament, sleep patterns, family functioning, asthma, and cognitive development. However, no significant relationship between colic and these features of later childhood have been proven."
2731#1#Tinnitus (ringing in the ears) ,"Tinnitus is the perception of a ringing, buzzing, hissing, or roaring sound in one or both ears. It may be continuous or intermittent (occasional), can be pulsing or steady, and can range in severity from a soft buzz to a loud ring.It is estimated that as many as 50 million people in the United States suffer from chronic tinnitus (lasting longer than six months) [1]; about a quarter of those have tinnitus that is severe enough to interfere with daily activities. Tinnitus is more common in men than women, and it becomes more common with aging [2,3].Although tinnitus can be annoying, it is not usually a sign of a serious problem. There are ways to mask and adapt to the symptoms to minimize the impact of tinnitus on daily life."
8425#4#Vaginal discharge in adult women ,"Vaginal discharge is common and normal. However, vaginal discharge with the following signs and symptoms is not normal and should be evaluated by a health care provider:Itching of the vulva, vaginal opening, or labiaRedness, burning, soreness, or swelling of the vulvar skinFoamy or greenish-yellow dischargeBad odorBlood-tinged vaginal dischargePain with intercourse or urinationAbdominal or pelvic pain"
2162#14#Thyroid nodules ,"Most people whose biopsy shows nodules with atypical cells require repeat fine-needle aspiration (FNA). The optimal treatment depends upon individual factors, such as your personal risk for thyroid cancer and your past test results (including biopsy, molecular testing, and ultrasound). Molecular markers are frequently used to select low-risk nodules for observation rather than surgery."
516#2#Osteoarthritis treatment ,"Nonpharmacologic (non-drug) therapies are a key part of osteoarthritis (OA) treatment and are recommended for everyone with OA. These can improve your arthritis symptoms and have minimal side effects, and they are usually the first treatments clinicians recommend. People who try these approaches often have varying degrees of improvement in their OA pain and ability to do their normal activities."
1201#14#Croup in infants and children ,"Moderate to severe croup should be evaluated in an emergency department or clinic capable of handling urgent respiratory illnesses. Severe croup is a life-threatening illness, and treatment should not be delayed for any reason.The treatment used depends upon the type and severity of signs and symptoms but may include one or more of the following:Humidified air or oxygen (if oxygen is necessary).IV fluids may be needed if the child is dehydrated as a result of fever or rapid breathing, both of which increase the body's loss of fluids. Difficulty breathing can discourage a child from drinking, which can increase the risk of dehydration.Monitoring of oxygen levels, breathing and heart rate, skin color (normal versus blue-tinged), and level of alertness are used to measure the child's status and response to treatment. A child who fails to improve or who improves slowly may need further treatment.Placement of a breathing tube in the throat is rarely needed for children with severe croup; less than 1 percent of children seen in the emergency department require intubation."
1200#17#Chronic abdominal pain in children and adolescents ,"Studies have not shown that making changes in the diet are helpful for children with chronic abdominal pain. However, the following changes might be helpful in selected children. In general, a two-week dietary trial is sufficient to show some beneficial effect. If no beneficial effect is seen after two weeks, a regular diet should be resumed."
"7635#10#Common warts, plantar warts, and flat warts ","Cantharidin is a liquid that is applied by a health care provider to treat skin warts. It may be particularly useful for young children because it causes no pain initially. However, some people develop pain, blisters, and swelling 2 to 24 hours after the treatment.The skin usually heals within 5 to 10 days after treatment. "
4426#7#Peritoneal dialysis ,"After the catheter site has healed (approximately two weeks after insertion), your dialysis nurse will instruct you on catheter exit-site care. It will be important to keep the area clean to minimize the risk of skin infection, as well as infection inside the abdomen (called peritonitis). In addition, most centers will recommend that you ""anchor"" the catheter with tape to stabilize the catheter and minimize the chance of movement causing some injury to the healed exit site.The skin around the catheter site should be washed daily or every other day with antibacterial soap or an antiseptic (either povidone iodine or chlorhexidine). The soap should be stored in the original bottle (not poured into another container). Other types of cleansers, such as hydrogen peroxide or alcohol, should NOT be used unless directed by a health care provider.Before cleaning the area, wash your hands with soap and water and put on clean gloves.Hold the catheter still during cleaning, which helps prevent injury to the skin.Do not pick at or remove crusts or scabs at the site.Pat the skin around the site dry after cleaning. A clean cloth or towel is suggested.Apply a prescription antibiotic cream to the skin around the catheter with a cotton-tip swab every time the dressing is changed.Avoid using tapes or dressings that prevent air from reaching the skin. The site should be covered with a sterile gauze dressing, which should be changed every time the site is cleaned. The catheter should be anchored to the skin with tape or a specially designed adhesive.With appropriate catheter placement and exit-site care, most peritoneal dialysis catheters are problem free and work for many years. If the catheter no longer works or is needed, a minor surgical procedure is required to remove it."
1222#11#Asthma symptoms and diagnosis in children ,"Spirometry measures the flow and volume of air blown out after a child takes a very deep breath and then forcefully exhales. If airflow obstruction is present, the test may be repeated after the child uses an asthma inhaler or nebulizer (bronchodilator) to confirm that the obstruction is reversible (a feature of asthma).Children younger than six years sometimes have a hard time following the instructions to perform spirometry. Testing of younger children and infants is described below. (See 'Testing for young children' below.)"
4866#9#Depression treatment options for adults ,"All forms of psychotherapy include support from a professional who is focused on helping you to make positive changes. There are many specific types of psychotherapy that are used to treat depression. Each works in a slightly different way, but all have been proven to help improve the symptoms of depression. What’s more, many psychotherapists use a combination of techniques when working with clients. Options include the following:Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) – In CBT you work with a therapist to identify and reshape the thought and behavior patterns that contribute to your depression.Interpersonal psychotherapy – In interpersonal psychotherapy, you focus on your relationships, the way that you interact with other people in your life, and the different roles you play. Often you learn new ways to interact that can help improve those relationshipsFamily and couples therapy – In family and couples therapy, you attend therapy sessions along with your partner or family members so that you can work together on the issues that are contributing to your depression.Problem solving therapy – In problem-solving therapy, you take a very practical and systematic approach to the problems in your life and find effective ways to solve them. If you are unemployed, for example, you work with your therapist to develop action steps you can accomplish as a way of achieving your goal of getting a job.Psychodynamic psychotherapy – In psychodynamic therapy, you might explore childhood or historic life events and work to reduce their influence by gaining insight into how they may be shaping your current behavior."
686#16#Hematopoietic cell transplantation (bone marrow transplantation) ,"Patients who will be in the hospital for several weeks or months need to make plans regarding their family, home, finances, pets, and employment. The National Marrow Donor Program has excellent information about these and other stem cell transplantation related topics.During the pre-transplant planning process, you should consider completing an advanced directive. This is a legal document that describes the type of care you want in case you are unable to communicate. Advance directives include a living will, durable power of attorney, and healthcare proxy; a social worker or attorney can provide guidance about what documents are needed. The laws surrounding these documents vary from one state to another, so it is important to be sure the correct guidelines are used. "
1194#7#Bloody stools in children ,"Sometimes a health care provider can determine the cause of the bleeding by inspecting the outside of the anus. This may include a brief examination of the inside of the anus using a finger (rectal examination). The health care provider can also test a sample of stool to be sure whether or not it contains blood. The stool can be tested for infection by a bacterium, virus, or parasite by sending a specimen to the laboratory for testing.This examination may be all that is necessary. If the cause of the bleeding is not clear based upon the examination, further testing may be recommended. This might include blood tests and, in some cases, a colonoscopy (figure 2) and/or upper endoscopy (figure 3). Colonoscopy is an examination of the lower part of the gastrointestinal tract (also known as the colon or large bowel), which is performed by insertion of a thin, flexible tube with a camera attached. An upper endoscopy is a similar procedure in which the health care provider examines the upper part of the gastrointestinal tract, which includes the esophagus, the stomach, and the duodenum (the first section of the small intestine). (See  ""Patient education: Colonoscopy (Beyond the Basics)"" and  ""Patient education: Upper endoscopy (Beyond the Basics)"".)Other tests may also be helpful in some cases. If examination of the small bowel is needed to identify the source of bleeding, tests may include may include video capsule endoscopy, upper gastrointestinal series with small bowel follow-through (UGI/SBFT), or magnetic resonance enterography. Other tests may include computed tomography (CT), ultrasound, nuclear medicine studies (Meckel scan or tagged red blood cell scan), or angiography. The health care provider chooses between these tests depending on the child's history and symptoms."
871#1#Endometrial cancer treatment after surgery ,"Endometrial cancer is a type of uterine cancer that involves the lining of the uterus (the endometrium). Treatment for endometrial cancer usually includes surgical removal of the uterus, cervix, ovaries, and fallopian tubes; it may also involve sampling or removal of the surrounding lymph nodes. There are two types of endometrial cancer, which are classified by their relationship to estrogen stimulation. More information on the epidemiology, diagnosis, staging, and treatment of endometrial cancer is available by subscription. This topic will discuss the medical and radiation approaches for endometrial cancer following surgical treatment. (See  ""Patient education: Uterine cancer (The Basics)"" and  ""Patient education: Endometrial cancer diagnosis and staging (Beyond the Basics)"".)"
4869#12#Bipolar disorder ,"Lithium has been used for many years to treat mania. Studies also demonstrate that lithium may decrease the risk of suicide or self-harm (hurting oneself even without intending suicide). Common side effects of lithium can include frequent urination, tremor, loose stools, difficulty thinking clearly, or weight gain. Problems with kidney function, heart rhythm, or thyroid functioning can occur in people who take lithium for long periods of time.A test to measure the lithium level in the blood is recommended regularly when taking lithium. Blood testing is usually done every 6 to 12 months once the lithium dose is stabilized.Lithium can cause serious problems if you take an overdose or if your kidneys do not work normally. This can occur if you becomes severely dehydrated or take certain medicines with lithium. If you take lithium, talk to your healthcare provider before taking any new non-prescription or prescription medicines."
2019#6#Colon polyps ,"The most common types of polyps are hyperplastic and adenomatous polyps. Other types of polyps can also be found in the colon, although these are far less common and are not discussed here."
3446#9#Heart failure ,"As the amount of blood pumped by the heart (the ""cardiac output"") decreases, a variety of symptoms can develop, including:Shortness of breath, which might require you to cut back on your normal activities and/or sleep with several pillows to elevate your head.Feeling tired or fatigued quickly.Weakness, particularly of the legs, when exercising.Lightheadedness or dizziness.A rapid heart rate, even while resting.Swelling in the lower legs and feet (edema) or in the abdomen (ascites). (See  ""Patient education: Edema (swelling) (Beyond the Basics)"".) Unintentional weight loss (in severe heart failure)."
1182#5#Autism spectrum disorder ,"Symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are usually recognized between two and three years of age, although they may be present earlier. By definition, symptoms must be present in early development, but sometimes the symptoms are not apparent until the child is older. Symptoms cluster into two broad areas: 1) social communication and 2) restricted and repetitive behavior, activities, and interests.Speech or language delay noticed by the caregivers or primary care provider often is the first sign that a child may have ASD. Less common signs include lack of eye contact or little interest in other people. Reasons for caregivers to seek help are discussed below. (See 'When to seek help' below.)"
4869#18#Bipolar disorder ,"Antidepressants are sometimes used to treat people with bipolar depression, sometimes in combination with a mood stabilizer. However, people with bipolar disorder who use antidepressants must be monitored closely because there is a chance that antidepressants can cause a manic episode."
1185#9#Starting solid foods during infancy ,"Single-ingredient puréed foods, including meats, vegetables, and fruits, should be introduced one at a time, every few days. If your child has no signs or symptoms of an allergic reaction, a second food may be added. Signs and symptoms of a food allergy include hives (skin welts) or other skin rash, facial swelling, vomiting, diarrhea, coughing, wheezing, difficulty breathing, weakness, or pale skin. Consult your child's health care provider if any of these problems occur. (See  ""Patient education: Food allergy symptoms and diagnosis (Beyond the Basics)"".)The goal is to expose your infant to new flavors and textures of food. The amount eaten is less important. The order in which foods are introduced (vegetable, fruit, or meat first) is probably less important than the texture and consistency of the food.By the time your infant is eight months of age, we suggest that he or she consume two to three tablespoons of fruits and vegetables twice per day [3]. First foods should be finely puréed, contain only one ingredient, and should not contain additives (salt, sugar). Vitamin C (also called ascorbic acid) is often added to commercially prepared infant foods.Second foods are puréed or strained, often contain two or more ingredients (eg, fruit and grain, meat and vegetable), and should not contain additives (salt, sugar). Combination foods may be given after your child tolerates the individual components. Once thin purées are tolerated, thicker purées can be introduced.Third foods are usually combinations of food types, some of which have texture to encourage chewing. Some are seasoned with spices, although foods should not contain added salt or sugar. Chunkier blends often contain puréed food with small pieces of pasta, vegetables, or meat."
4421#5#Kidney (renal) biopsy ,"Serious complications of kidney biopsy are not common. Less serious complications can occur, and can include bleeding, pain, and development of an abnormal connection between two blood vessels (a fistula). Rare complications include infection, damage to blood vessels or other organs, or urine leaks."
2010#5#Gas and bloating ,"Some people feel they pass an excessive amount of gas or burp too frequently. Other people notice bloating and crampy abdominal pain. You may feel this pain in areas where gas can become trapped (figure 1), such as in bends in the colon, which occur naturally in the area under the liver (upper to mid-right part of the abdomen), and in the area under the spleen (upper to mid left part of the abdomen)."
1215#12#Constipation in infants and children ,"You can try using home remedies first to relieve your child's constipation. These remedies should begin to work within 24 hours; if your child does not have a bowel movement with 24 hours or if you are worried, call your child's doctor or nurse for advice."
4416#5#High blood pressure in adults ,"Stage 1: 130 to 139 over 80 to 89Stage 2: At least 140 over at least 90Most adults with hypertension have primary hypertension (formerly called ""essential"" hypertension), which means that the cause of the high blood pressure is not known. A small subset of adults has secondary hypertension, which means that there is an underlying and potentially correctable cause, usually a kidney or hormonal disorder."
7637#6#Contact dermatitis (including latex dermatitis) ,"The goal of treatment of irritant contact dermatitis is to restore the normal skin barrier and protect the skin from future injury. Reducing or avoiding altogether exposure to known irritants is essential. In some cases, simply reducing the use of soap and using an emollient cream or ointment completely alleviates symptoms. Wearing gloves when working with irritants may help as well.In more severe cases, topical corticosteroids (steroids) may be recommended. Steroid creams and ointments are available in a variety of strengths (potencies); the least potent are available in the United States without a prescription (eg, hydrocortisone 1% cream). More potent formulations require a prescription.Steroid treatments for contact dermatitis are most effective when applied and covered with a barrier, such as plastic wrap, a dressing (eg, Telfa), cotton gloves, or petroleum jelly."
691#13#Diffuse large B cell lymphoma in adults ,"Staging involves dividing people into groups (stages) based upon how much of the lymphatic system is involved at the time of diagnosis. Staging helps determine a person's prognosis and treatment options (table 1).Here is how the stages of lymphoma are defined:Stage I – Only one lymph node region is involved, only one lymph structure is involved, or only one extranodal site (IE) is involved.Stage II – Two or more lymph node regions or lymph node structures on the same side of the diaphragm are involved.Stage III – Lymph node regions or structures on both sides of the diaphragm are involved.Stage IV – There is widespread involvement of a number of organs or tissues other than lymph node regions or structures, such as the liver, lung, or bone marrow.When a stage is assigned, it also includes a letter, A or B, to denote whether fever, weight loss, or night sweats are present. ""A"" means these symptoms are not present; ""B"" means they are. For example, a person with stage 1B disease has evidence of cancer in one lymph node region and has ""B"" symptoms (fever, weight loss, or night sweats). (See 'Diffuse large B cell lymphoma symptoms' above.)"
1207#3#Treatment of seizures in children ,"Medications used to prevent seizure are called antiseizure medications, antiepileptic medications, or anticonvulsant medications.Most medications are started at a low dose and slowly increased until seizures no longer occur.The dose of the medication may be adjusted as the child grows and weight increases or as new medications are added for other problems (eg, asthma).A second antiseizure medication may be added or substituted if the first medication was only partially effective in stopping seizures, or if there were significant side effects with the first medication."
"1740#10#Type 2 diabetes: Alcohol, exercise, and medical care ","Most of the benefits of exercise for people with diabetes require a regular, long-term exercise program. Patients should commit to exercising 30 minutes a day most days of the week."
4011#2#Lyme disease symptoms and diagnosis ,"In the United States, Lyme disease commonly occurs in three regions: the northeast and mid-Atlantic states (from Maine to Virginia), the midwest (Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan), and on the west coast (in northern California). (See  ""Epidemiology of Lyme disease"".)Although Lyme disease has been found in many states, more than 90 percent of cases in the United States have been reported from ten states: Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Minnesota, and Wisconsin.Within these states, there are ""hot spots"" where Lyme disease occurs most frequently; other locations in these states have a much lower rate of infection. These ""hot spots"" are the result of local environmental conditions.The availability of food and water resources to the deer population is probably an important factor in the number of cases of Lyme disease. In addition, property at or near the border of forests is a preferred area for field mice, which carry deer ticks. Living in an area that borders a forest increases the risk of becoming infected with Lyme disease, especially for people who spend a lot of time outdoors.Lyme disease also occurs in Europe and Asia (where it is often called Lyme borreliosis rather than Lyme disease). The signs and symptoms, organisms causing the disease, and ticks carrying the disease are somewhat different in Europe and Asia compared with the United States."
7628#6#Scabies ,"Scabies is usually diagnosed based upon symptoms (widespread itching, presence of bumps) and history (eg, whether family members or sexual partners also have these signs). A health care provider may be able to confirm the diagnosis by scraping the top layers of skin at the site of a lesion and examining it under a microscope for mites or eggs; however, this is not usually necessary.Anyone who has symptoms of scabies should see their health care provider to be evaluated and confirm the diagnosis."
366#1#How to use a peak flow meter ,"The management of asthma relies on a patient's ability to monitor their asthma regularly. Self-monitoring includes assessing the frequency and severity of symptoms (such as wheezing and shortness of breath) and measurement of lung function with a peak flow meter.Peak flow meters measure your peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), a number that correlates with how open the lung's airways are; as asthma worsens and the airways narrow, the PEFR decreases. Monitoring can help you and your healthcare provider determine the most appropriate asthma treatment plan.A number of articles about asthma are available. For children, (see  ""Patient education: Asthma symptoms and diagnosis in children (Beyond the Basics)"" and  ""Patient education: Asthma inhaler techniques in children (Beyond the Basics)"" and  ""Patient education: Trigger avoidance in asthma (Beyond the Basics)"").For adults, (see  ""Patient education: Asthma treatment in adolescents and adults (Beyond the Basics)"" and  ""Patient education: Inhaler techniques in adults (Beyond the Basics)"" and  ""Patient education: Asthma and pregnancy (Beyond the Basics)"")."
4423#25#The nephrotic syndrome ,"The best treatment for membranous nephropathy is a source of debate. In many people, a period of ""watch and wait"" is recommended initially to determine if the condition is worsening or causing complications. During this time, an ACE inhibitor or ARB is recommended, and it is important to keep blood pressure and cholesterol levels controlled. Additional treatment, including medications that suppress the immune system, may be needed if membranous nephropathy progresses.Without immunosuppressive treatment, approximately 10 to 30 percent of people with membranous nephropathy have a complete resolution of symptoms over several years, a further 10 to 30 percent of people have a partial remission, and approximately 40 percent of people slowly lose kidney function. As a result, most people with mild symptoms are advised to delay immunosuppressive treatment until/unless symptoms worsen. (See  ""Membranous nephropathy: Treatment and prognosis"".)"
2007#2#Fecal incontinence ,"Continence requires the normal function of both the lower digestive tract and the nervous system. The anal sphincters, along with the pelvic muscles that surround the end of the digestive tract including the puborectalis muscle, ensure controlled movement of digestive tract contents. There are many possible causes of fecal incontinence; in most cases, incontinence results from a combination of these causes."
1200#1#Chronic abdominal pain in children and adolescents ,"Chronic and recurrent abdominal pain is common in children. The term ""functional abdominal pain disorder"" refers to pain that cannot be attributed to another medical condition after an appropriate medical evaluation has been conducted. Functional abdominal pain disorders (FAPDs) are considered the result of abnormal interactions between the gut and the brain. FAPDs are the most common cause of chronic abdominal pain in children and adolescents, occurring in 9 to 15 percent of all children. In males, pain is most common between ages 5 and 6 years. Females have pain most commonly between 5 and 6 years and 9 and 10 years.In most cases, abdominal pain is not serious and gets better without treatment. However, when it is lasts a long time or happens over and over again and a specific cause has not been found, treatment can be difficult. The pain can affect the child's ability to have a normal life, including attending school. This topic reviews treatment approaches that can help your child cope with the pain and/or help the pain go away.A topic review that discusses abdominal pain in adults is available separately. (See  ""Patient education: Upset stomach (functional dyspepsia) in adults (Beyond the Basics)"".)"
1205#5#Colic (excessive crying) in infants ,"There are a number of reasons, other than colic, that an infant may cry excessively; these can range from simple problems such as hunger to more serious problems such as infection.A parent should first check for manageable causes of crying:Hunger – Try feeding the baby to see whether hunger is the problem. Although most young infants (younger than three months) feed every two to four hours, all babies go through periods when they will want to feed more frequently (usually during growth spurts).Pain – Check to see if the baby is uncomfortable because of illness or physical injury. Feel the skin to determine if the baby is overheated or too cold. Check to see if the clothing or diaper is too tight or if a hair is wrapped around a finger, toe, or the penis (called a hair tourniquet).Fatigue or overstimulation – Babies often cry when they become tired or overstimulated from playing or being handled. Swaddling the baby loosely, leaving room for the legs to move (figure 1), offering a pacifier, or a change of scenery (such as a stroller or car ride) may help the baby to fall asleep.Food sensitivities – Infants can have an allergy or sensitivity to foods in their mother's diet or a component of their formula. Foods such as milk, eggs, nuts, and wheat in a mother's diet have a direct effect on the composition of her breast milk; these foods can occasionally cause food reactions and digestive problems such as abdominal pain, cramping, and diarrhea. Infants also can be allergic to a protein in cow's milk-based formulas or dairy products consumed by the mother (if the infant is breastfeeding); cow's milk protein allergy may cause fussiness and blood in the stools. Lactose (a type of sugar found in cow's milk) intolerance has little to no effect on the development of colic.Food sensitivities may be suspected if an infant cries or spits up a large amount within an hour of feeding or if a baby has constipation or diarrhea. Symptoms of cow's milk allergy include eczema, wheezing, diarrhea, or vomiting. Symptoms of cow's milk protein allergy include fussiness and blood in the stool. (See  ""Patient education: Acid reflux (gastroesophageal reflux) in infants (Beyond the Basics)"".)If these causes have been eliminated and the baby continues to cry excessively, parents should speak with their health care provider. Most infants who cry excessively do not have a serious underlying medical problem; a health care provider can help to make this determination. (See 'When to seek help' below.)"
3695#1#Symptoms of HIV ,"It is important to recognize symptoms of HIV as soon as possible since early diagnosis and treatment will prevent serious illness. Early treatment will also reduce your chances of transmitting the virus to others.This article discusses the early signs and symptoms of HIV and the groups that are at risk for becoming infected with HIV. A separate article discusses testing for HIV. (See  ""Patient education: Testing for HIV (Beyond the Basics)"".)"
4424#12#High blood pressure treatment in adults ,"Beta blockers block some of the effects of the sympathetic nervous system, which increases the heart rate and raises blood pressure with stress and/or activity. Beta blockers lower blood pressure in part by decreasing the rate and force at which the heart pumps blood.The available beta blockers include acebutolol, atenolol, betaxolol, bisoprolol, metoprolol, nadolol, nebivolol, pindolol, propranolol, and timolol.Some beta blockers have combined activity, blocking both the beta and alpha receptors (see next section). These include labetalol and carvedilol."
6735#18#Gestational diabetes ,"Women who have had gestational diabetes in the past are at increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease, including heart attack and stroke. While this is mostly tied to the risk of type 2 diabetes (see above), even women who do not progress to type 2 diabetes appear to have a small increase in their risk of heart disease later in life. Continuing to make healthy lifestyle choices such as eating a balanced diet, exercising regularly, and avoiding smoking can help minimize this risk."
689#10#Warfarin ,"Although warfarin does not pass into breast milk, a woman who wishes to breastfeed while taking warfarin should consult her healthcare provider. Warfarin is considered safe for use in breastfeeding women and their infants."
2001#6#Chronic pancreatitis ,"Chronic pancreatitis can lead to a variety of complications, including the following (see  ""Overview of the complications of chronic pancreatitis""):Blockage of the ducts that drain the pancreas and gallbladder, which can lead to jaundice (yellowing of the skin) and bouts of worsening pancreatitisBlockage of the upper intestineAn increased risk of pancreatic cancer"
4416#4#High blood pressure in adults ,"120 to 129 over less than 80.People with elevated blood pressure are at increased risk of developing hypertension and cardiovascular complications; however, medications used to treat hypertension are not known to be beneficial in people with elevated blood pressure."
4001#7#West Nile virus infection ,Most people infected with West Nile (WN) virus never develop symptoms and will not know that they have the virus. The virus remains in the body for a few days before the immune system begins to fight the infection and eliminate it. Individuals that become ill generally exhibit symptoms within two to 15 days of acquiring the virus. It is believed that persons who are infected with WN virus have lifelong immunity and cannot get a second WN virus infection.
8409#5#Genital warts in women ,"There are many ways to treat genital warts: some involve using a medicine and some involve a procedure. Even with treatment, it is possible that the warts will come back within a few weeks or months. This is because treating the warts does not necessarily get rid of all of the virus (HPV) causing the warts. Some cells in the normal-appearing genital skin and vagina may remain infected with HPV. There is currently no treatment that will permanently get rid of HPV in all infected cells, but most people will clear the virus and the warts with their own immune systems within two years. (See  ""Condylomata acuminata (anogenital warts): Treatment of vulvar and vaginal warts"".)The ""best"" treatment for warts depends on how many warts you have, where they are located, certain health conditions (such as pregnancy and diseases affecting the immune system), and you and your health care provider's preferences. Warts do not necessarily need to be treated, especially if they are not bothersome. Your doctor or midwife may recommend treatment of large warts in pregnancy to avoid blockage of the vaginal opening. It is not clear that treating warts in pregnancy will prevent passage of HPV to the baby."
1175#5#Gastroesophageal reflux disease in children and adolescents ,"Barium is a substance that can be seen easily with X-ray. It can be mixed into a liquid that the child swallows. After the liquid is swallowed, the barium coats the lining of the esophagus, and a special type of X-ray (fluoroscopy) is used to see the shape and structure of the mouth, esophagus, and stomach.A barium swallow, sometimes called an upper gastrointestinal series, is a test that might be recommended for infants and children who have forceful vomiting or difficulty or pain with swallowing. A barium swallow is not usually done to confirm whether the child has reflux but instead is used to look for structural abnormalities such as a twist in the bowel or a web in the stomach (both of which are rare). This test can also be helpful in evaluating causes of vomiting as well as pain or difficulty swallowing (eg, a narrowing or problems with peristalsis [muscle movements] in the esophagus)."
1214#8#Why does my child need vaccines? ,"Vaccines are available for every child in the United States, even for those who do not have health insurance. If a child does not have health insurance and the parents or caregivers are unable to pay for vaccines, a program called Vaccines for Children is available. This program helps to cover the costs of vaccines given at private doctor's offices, clinics, hospitals, community health clinics, and in some schools."
682#14#Blood donation and transfusion ,"Zika virus causes a mild infection in most people, but if a pregnant woman is infected, the virus can cause miscarriage or serious brain abnormalities in the baby. Testing of blood for Zika virus was started in the United States in the summer of 2017 but has been discontinued as there is no longer an active Zika epidemic in the Americas."
712#3#Knee pain ,"This is the most common cause of overuse knee pain. It causes pain in the front of the knee or deep in the knee behind the kneecap which worsens with squatting, running, prolonged sitting, or when climbing or descending steps. The pain usually comes on over time, without one specific episode of injury. Patellofemoral pain almost never results in a swollen knee.  Think of the kneecap as a train and the groove of the thigh bone (femur) as a track: anything that causes the train (kneecap) to run off the track (thigh bone) can result in patellofemoral pain. The most common causes of patellofemoral pain are weak muscles (quadriceps and gluteals), tight muscles (hamstrings, quadriceps, and hip flexors), abnormal limb alignment (flat or high arched feet, knock knees or rotated hips), and/or overuse trauma from increasing physical training too quickly. Effective treatments include muscle strengthening exercises, muscle stretches, and slow progressive training regimens. Occasionally braces, taping, or foot orthotics may be helpful and can be prescribed by your physician. (See  ""Patellofemoral pain"".)"
2279#2#Allergic conjunctivitis ,"Allergic conjunctivitis is caused by airborne allergens that come in contact with the eye. Symptoms may be sudden in onset (acute), seasonal, or present year-round (perennial), depending upon the allergen."
710#4#Frozen shoulder ,"People who have frozen shoulder often go through three phases of symptoms:The first phase lasts two to nine months and involves diffuse, severe, and disabling shoulder pain that is worse at night. During this phase, the shoulder becomes increasingly stiff.The second (intermediate) phase lasts 4 to 12 months. During this phase, the shoulder becomes very stiff and has limited mobility, but the pain gradually lessens.The third (recovery) phase lasts 5 to 24 months. During this phase, people gradually regain range of motion.If you have frozen shoulder, the pain and stiffness it causes may seriously interfere with your ability to do everyday tasks, such as dress and bathe, or even work. Even once the pain of frozen shoulder starts to improve, the shoulder stiffness may still be quite limiting. For example, the condition might impede you from reaching overhead, to the side, or across your chest; or from rotating your arm all the way around from front to back. This could make it impossible for you to scratch your back or put on a coat."
2168#11#Antithyroid drugs ,"No test can reliably predict remission of Graves' disease. While imperfect, the measurement of TSH-receptor antibodies (TRAb) is widely used in the United States and Europe to determine if a person is in remission.Usually, after one to two years of treatment, TRAb is measured, and if low, your clinician will recommend stopping the antithyroid drug, and the chance of a remission is 80 percent. However, if TRAb remains high, the chance of a remission is under 20 percent, and it is appropriate to reconsider definitive therapy with radioiodine or surgery or continue antithyroid drugs.If antithyroid drugs are stopped, thyroid blood tests are usually performed four to eight weeks later. The blood tests are periodically repeated over 12 months to determine if hormone levels remain normal or increase over time (this is called a recurrence).If your levels of T3, T4, and TSH remain normal for 12 months, the long-term prognosis is good. Recurrence after this time occurs in only 8 to 10 percent of people."
2169#11#Calcium and vitamin D for bone health ,"The current recommendation is that men over 70 years and postmenopausal women consume at least 800 international units (20 micrograms) of vitamin D per day. Lower levels of vitamin D are not as effective, while high doses can be toxic, especially if taken for long periods of time. Although the optimal intake has not been clearly established in premenopausal women or in younger men with osteoporosis, 600 international units (15 micrograms) of vitamin D daily is generally suggested.Vitamin D is available as an individual supplement and is included in most multivitamins and some calcium supplements (table 2). Milk is a relatively good dietary source of vitamin D, with approximately 100 international units (2.5 micrograms) per cup (240 mL), and salmon has 800 to 1000 international units (20 to 25 micrograms) of vitamin D per serving (table 3).Most healthy people don't need to check with their health care provider before taking standard doses of vitamin D and don't need monitoring of vitamin D levels if they are not being treated for vitamin D deficiency. However, recommendations for vitamin D supplementation may be different in people with certain underlying medical conditions, such as sarcoidosis or lymphoma. In these situations, a provider will determine if supplements are needed; if so, the person's vitamin D and calcium levels should be monitored with regular tests."
3445#3#Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy ,"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a disorder caused by a ""spelling mistake"" (mutation) in one of a number of different genes which encode for the structure of the heart. Not all the genes responsible for HCM have been identified. The disorder is transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait. This means that there is a 50 percent chance that a parent with HCM will pass the abnormal gene to his or her child. However, not all family members who inherit an HCM mutation will develop disease and can remain only a carrier of the mutation. Men and women are equally likely to inherit HCM. If a child does inherit the mutation, the most likely period in which the disease will develop (ie, the heart wall muscle thickening) is during puberty, although the severity of heart disease that will develop cannot be accurately predicted. In addition, the thickness of the muscle that patients have at the end of adolescence is usually the thickness that they will have the rest of their life. In this regard, for the vast majority of patients, the heart muscle does not continue to grow and get bigger throughout life. For this reason, other factors related to HCM, including the function of the muscle and the obstruction to blood flow out of the heart, can cause symptoms to develop at any time during the life of the patient.In HCM, the muscular walls of the left ventricle become thickened (figure 2). The location and pattern of wall thickening is diverse, but the majority of patients have increased wall thickening of the basal (upper) portion of the ventricular septum (muscle dividing the two bottom chambers). However, occasionally patients may have thickening confined to only other areas such as the apex (tip of the heart). As the left ventricular wall thickens, its ability to relax properly is impaired, causing blood flow into the ventricle to be reduced, like a weight lifter whose muscles may be strong, but stiff.The mitral valve may also make an abnormal motion and contact the thickened septum during the ejection phase of blood out of the heart, which can cause obstruction of blood flowing out of the left ventricle (obstructive HCM). This can result in higher pressures than normal in the left ventricle, and the involvement of the mitral valve may also prevent the valve from closing completely and allow blood to leak through the opening and back into the left atrium (known as mitral regurgitation). Other heart-related complications can also develop. The majority of patients with HCM have obstruction to blood flow out of the heart either at rest or with exertion, while the minority of patients with HCM do not have obstruction to blood flow out of the heart (nonobstructive HCM). (See 'Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy complications' below.)"
1745#2#Type 2 diabetes: Insulin treatment ,"Keeping your blood sugar levels under control is one way to decrease the risk of complications related to type 2 diabetes, particularly microvascular complications. (""Micro"" means small, and ""vascular"" means blood vessels.) These can affect the eyes, kidneys, and nerves; these problems can lead to serious issues including blindness, kidney failure, foot ulcers requiring amputation, and impotence in men. Microvascular complications usually occur after a person has had diabetes for many years, and they are related to elevated levels of blood sugar over time. However, in some cases (eg, if a person has already had diabetes for a long time before they seek medical care), these complications may be present at the time of initial diagnosis.The most common complication of type 2 diabetes is cardiovascular (heart) disease, also known as macrovascular disease (""macro"" means large, ie, affecting the large blood vessels). Heart disease increases a person's risk of heart attack and death. There are ways to lower your risk of heart disease, including lifestyle changes (such as avoiding smoking, eating a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and maintaining a healthy weight) and medications to control blood pressure and cholesterol, if needed. Specific diabetes drugs also help reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease in people with or at high risk for cardiovascular disease. (See  ""Patient education: Preventing complications from diabetes (Beyond the Basics)"".)"
8392#5#Colposcopy ,"Some people feel a little dizzy or nauseated right after the colposcopy. If you feel this way, tell your provider and lie down until the feeling goes away. Sometimes a cold compress applied to your forehead may help you feel better. If you have a history of fainting or feeling lightheaded after other procedures, be sure to tell your provider and wait a few minutes after the colposcopy before sitting up.If you have a biopsy of your cervix, you may have some vaginal bleeding after the colposcopy. If your provider used the liquid bandage solution, you may have brown or black vaginal discharge that looks like coffee grounds. This should resolve within a few days.Most people can return to work or school immediately after having a colposcopy. Some people have mild pain or cramping, but this usually goes away within one to two hours.Do not put anything in the vagina (creams, douches, tampons) and do not have sex for 48 hours after having a biopsy.If you have a biopsy, ask your health care provider when your results will be available (usually within 7 to 14 days). In most cases, further testing and treatment will depend on the results of the biopsy. (See  ""Patient education: Follow-up of low-grade abnormal Pap tests (Beyond the Basics)"" and  ""Patient education: Follow-up of high-grade or glandular cell abnormal Pap tests (Beyond the Basics)"" and  ""Patient education: Management of a cervical biopsy with precancerous cells (Beyond the Basics)"".)Do not assume that the biopsy results are normal if you do not hear from your health care provider: Call and inquire about the results. Most people will need a follow-up test (repeat cervical cancer screening [Pap smear] and/or colposcopy) within six months."
576#2#Polymyalgia rheumatica and giant cell arteritis ,"The most common symptoms of polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) are:Aching and stiffness in the morning in the shoulders and upper arms, hips and thighs, and back of the neck. Some people have trouble getting dressed (eg, fastening a bra, putting on a shirt or jacket, or pulling on stockings). Difficulty raising the arms above the shoulders is a typical symptom. Morning stiffness is often severe, can last for several hours, and can return during the day after inactivity.Occasional swelling or stiffness of the small joints of the hands. Swelling in the wrist can lead to numbness, tingling, and pain in the hands (called carpal tunnel syndrome).Feeling of tiredness, poor appetite, weight loss, or fever.Symptoms of PMR come on quickly over a period of weeks or even days."
"4415#7#High blood pressure, diet, and weight ","Reducing the amount of sodium you consume can lower blood pressure if you have hypertension or elevated blood pressure.The main source of sodium in the diet does not come from the salt shaker; it comes from the salt contained in packaged and processed foods and in foods from restaurants.The body requires a small amount of sodium in the diet, and most people consume more sodium than they need (over 3 grams per day). A low-sodium diet contains fewer than 2.4 grams (2400 milligrams) of sodium per day. Although the ideal target for daily sodium intake remains controversial, the optimal goal is less than 1500 mg per day.A detailed discussion of low-sodium diets is available separately. (See  ""Patient education: Low-sodium diet (Beyond the Basics)"".)"
1188#7#Mouth and dental injuries in children ,"Injuries to the teeth, especially those involving permanent teeth, will require long-term follow-up care. Even if the injured tooth appears healthy, it is still important for the parents to have their children evaluated by a dentist who is experienced in dental injuries. The length of these follow-ups may range from weeks to years after the injury, depending upon the age of the child and severity of injury."
3421#30#Syncope (fainting) ,"A pacemaker is a small device that is implanted under your skin. Wires from the device are threaded to the heart where they emit impulses that help regulate the heartbeat. Pacemakers are often recommended if you have syncope caused by sinus bradycardia, carotid sinus hypersensitivity, or heart block. Some new pacemakers are directly implanted within the heart. (See  ""Patient education: Pacemakers (Beyond the Basics)"".)"
3446#14#Heart failure ,"Medicines are often used to treat heart failure symptoms; some medicines have even been proven to prolong life. It is very important to take your medicines on time every single day. If you cannot afford or have trouble taking your medicines, talk to your health care provider.There are some differences in the medicines used to treat heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction."
4575#14#Hepatitis B ,"The risk of developing complications (such as cirrhosis, liver failure, or liver cancer) depends on how rapidly the virus multiplies and how well your immune system controls the infection. For patients with chronic hepatitis B, the risk of developing complications is:Higher in men than in women, and with increasing age.Increased by drinking alcohol, having chronic hepatitis C or D (a virus that is dependent on hepatitis B), or having HIV infection (the virus that causes AIDS).In addition, being overweight or having diabetes increases the risk of having fatty liver (fat accumulation in the liver), which can increase the rate of liver disease progression in people with hepatitis B."
375#4#Trigger avoidance in allergic rhinitis ,"Dust mites are a microscopic type of insect that live in bedding, sofas, carpets, or any woven material. Dust mites do not bite and do not cause harm to humans, other than by triggering allergies.Mites absorb humidity from the atmosphere (ie, they do not drink) and feed on organic matter (including shed human and animal skin). They require sufficient humidity and nests to live in (which are not visible with the naked eye). Dust mite infestation is less common in dry climates, such as the southwestern United States.Exposure to dust mites can be reduced by encasing pillows, mattresses, box springs, comforters, and furniture in mite-impermeable barriers. When covering crib mattresses and children's mattresses and pillows, only tight-fitting, commercial covers intended for this purpose should be used. Homemade covers (for example, plastic sheeting fastened with duct tape) should not be used in children's beds, as these can come apart, and children can become trapped or suffocate. Tightly-woven fabrics with a pore size of 6 microns or less are very effective at controlling the passage of mite as well as cat allergens. Fabrics with a pore size greater than 2 microns still permit airflow [3,4].Mites can be eliminated by washing sheets and blankets weekly in warm water with detergent or by drying them in an electric dryer on the hot setting (table 2). Exposure can be further reduced by vacuuming with a vacuum cleaner equipped with a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter, dusting regularly, and not sleeping on upholstered furniture (eg, couches). However, studies have yet to show that physical or chemical cleaning methods reduce mite levels to a degree that improves symptoms [5].Indoor humidity levels should be kept below 50 percent. Inexpensive humidity monitors can be purchased at most hardware stores. Humidifiers make the problem worse and are not recommended.When possible, the amount of clutter, carpet, upholstered furniture, and drapes should be minimized, and horizontal blinds should be eliminated in the rooms where the person spends the most time (bedroom, study, television room). Washable vinyl, roller-type shades are optimal. For children, the number of stuffed toys in the bedroom should be minimized."
710#2#Frozen shoulder ,"Frozen shoulder is a fairly common condition in the general population. The condition is most common in people in their 50s and 60s and rarely affects anyone younger than 40. Women are more often affected than men.Frozen shoulder usually affects only one shoulder (left or right) and gets better on its own, but it can last two to three years or even longer. People who get frozen shoulder on one side can go on to develop it on the other."
4575#5#Hepatitis B ,"Hepatitis B can be passed from a mother to her baby during or shortly after delivery. Having a Cesarean delivery (also called a C-section) does not prevent the virus from spreading. Experts believe that breastfeeding is safe for mothers with hepatitis B.To help prevent transmission from mother to infant, all pregnant women should have a blood test for a marker of hepatitis B virus, called hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). Normally, the HBsAg should be negative. If the mother is HBsAg-positive, she should be referred to a specialist. (See 'Preventing infection from mother to child' below.)"
6725#1#Postterm pregnancy ,"Although pregnancy is said to last nine months, health care providers track pregnancy by weeks and days. The estimated delivery date, also called the estimated due date or EDD, is calculated as 40 weeks or 280 days from the first day of the last menstrual period (LMP). Only 4 percent (1 in 20) women will deliver on their due date.The normal duration of pregnancy is 37 to 42 weeks, which is referred to as ""term."" A postterm pregnancy, also called a prolonged pregnancy, is one that has extended beyond 42 weeks or 294 days from the first day of the LMP. As many as 10 percent of pregnancies will deliver postterm."
2728#2#Lower extremity chronic venous disease ,"Any problem that increases pressure in the veins in the legs can dilate the veins. This can damage the valves, which leads to even higher pressures and worsened vein function and can eventually lead to chronic venous disease. The pressure inside the veins can increase for a number of reasons, including:A clot inside a vein – A clot will block blood flow through the vein and cause pressure to build up. Often this causes permanent damage to the vein or valves, even after the clot has dissolved.Leg injury or surgery – Injury or surgery that blocks the flow of blood through a vein can increase pressure. Excess weight or weight gain – The added weight of pregnancy or obesity can increase pressure in the veins of the legs and damage the veins and valves.Standing or sitting for too long – Standing or sitting for prolonged periods without walking can decrease the movement of blood from the legs toward the heart and lead to increased pressure in the veins and pooling of blood. This is because the muscles in the legs play an important role in the circulation of blood, acting as a pump to move blood from the legs back to the heart. "
1213#21#Bronchiolitis and RSV in infants and children ,"If, at any time, a child develops features of worsening or severe bronchiolitis, the parent should seek immediate medical attention. This includes:Difficulty breathing or appearing overwhelmed by the work of breathingPale or blue-tinged (cyanotic) skinSevere coughing spellsSevere sucking in of the skin around the ribs and base of the throat (retractions) with breathing (figure 2)If the child stops breathingDo not attempt to drive your child to the hospital yourself if the child is severely agitated, cyanotic, struggling to breathe, stops breathing, or is excessively drowsy (lethargic). In this situation, call emergency medical services (in the United States and Canada, dial 9-1-1).Call the child's doctor or nurse if:The child has a fever (temperature higher than 100.4°F or 38°C), particularly for infants who are younger than three months (table 1)The child has signs or symptoms of bronchiolitisThe child has difficulty feeding or has fewer wet diapers than usualYou have any questions or concerns about the child's condition"
4575#13#Hepatitis B ,"The likelihood of developing chronic hepatitis B largely depends on your age at the time of infection. Chronic infection develops in about 90 percent of children who are infected at birth, in 20 to 50 percent of children who are infected between the ages of 1 and 5 years, and in less than 5 percent of people infected with hepatitis B during adulthood."
700#7#Total hip replacement ,"Total hip replacement is performed in an operating room after you are given general or regional (epidural or spinal) anesthesia. The surgical approach used will be determined by your surgeon and is typically a single incision along the posterior (rear), lateral (side), or anterior (front) aspect of the hip. Less invasive hip replacement surgery techniques, which use smaller incisions and specialized instruments, are often used.The type of prosthesis and the material used for the ""bearing surface"" (outer layer) depends upon the needs of the particular patient and the surgeon performing the procedure. There are a variety of types of prosthetic bearing surfaces, including metal-on-plastic, ceramic-on-plastic, and ceramic-on-ceramic. An example of one type of prosthesis is shown here (figure 2). Each surface has unique advantages and disadvantages, and your surgeon can discuss which is appropriate for you. (See  ""Total hip arthroplasty"".)"
699#7#Paget disease of bone (osteitis deformans) ,The abnormal bone of Paget disease is more likely to fracture when exposed to weightbearing stresses.
8424#14#Bacterial vaginosis ,"Bacterial vaginosis (BV) can cause ""fishy smelling"" vaginal discharge, which may be worse after sex. Some women do not have this discharge.BV is considered by some experts to be a sexually transmitted infection. Sexual partners do not need to be treated since treatment of males is not effective for preventing infection of the female partner. Some experts recommend that male partners use condoms. Female partners should be treated with standard therapy.Do not treat yourself for abnormal vaginal discharge. A doctor or nurse should first perform an exam to determine the reason for the discharge.Several prescription medications are available to treat BV; some are vaginal gels or creams while others are pills that you take by mouth. Pills may be more convenient but usually cause side effects (nausea, metallic taste).Some women develop BV repeatedly. A treatment may be recommended to prevent infections. This includes a vaginal gel twice per week for three to six months.Pregnant women with BV infection should be treated. This usually includes pills that are taken by mouth."
8417#5#Follow-up of high-grade or glandular cell abnormal Pap tests ,"For people who have an abnormal Pap test while they are pregnant, the next steps are based on ensuring the appropriate evaluation while avoiding pregnancy-related complications. For example, during pregnancy, a biopsy of the cervix is only done if there is a high concern regarding a precancerous or cancerous lesion.If you are pregnant and have a Pap test with high-grade intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) or atypical glandular cells (AGC), you should have a colposcopy. However, endocervical and endometrial biopsies are not performed in this situation. Sometimes, the colposcopy can be delayed until after delivery (usually four weeks postpartum)."
1191#7#Blood in the urine (hematuria) in children ,"There is no specific treatment for hematuria. Rather, treatment is aimed at the underlying cause, if a cause can be determined. Treatment of specific causes of hematuria is discussed separately. (See  ""Patient education: Urinary tract infections in children (Beyond the Basics)"" and  ""Patient education: Kidney stones in children (Beyond the Basics)"".)"
6720#7#Preeclampsia ,"Preeclampsia can impair the ability of the placenta to provide adequate nutrition and oxygen to the fetus, which can have the following effects:Abnormal testing of fetal well-being (such as a nonreactive nonstress test or low biophysical profile score).Slowed growth of the fetus, usually noted by an ultrasound examination.Decreased amount of amniotic fluid around the fetus, usually noted by an ultrasound examination.Decreased blood flow through the umbilical cord, noted on Doppler tests (performed during ultrasound examination)."
7634#15#Acne ,"People who cannot tolerate retinoids may try other topical medications, such as salicylic acid, glycolic acid, or azelaic acid (Azelex, Finacea). All of these treatments can be helpful in reducing noninflammatory acne, and azelaic acid may reduce acne-related darkening of skin."
1200#9#Chronic abdominal pain in children and adolescents ,"A pain diary is a way to keep track of a child's pain during usual daily activities. Typically, pain is recorded over the course of one week (including a weekend). At the end of each day, the following information is recorded (figure 1):How bad the pain was (for example, on a scale from 1 to 5)When the pain occurredIf the pain prevented activities (school, sports, play)Where the pain was locatedPossible triggers (food, activities, stressors, thoughts, feelings)How long the pain lastedIf anything helped the pain go awayYou can review the pain diary with the doctor or nurse at the next office visit. Pain that tends to occur only during school hours or only at home suggests a functional disorder. However, some children with chronic abdominal pain have pain during fun activities as well."
871#12#Endometrial cancer treatment after surgery ,"Radiation therapy (RT) refers to the use of high-energy X-rays to slow or stop the growth of cancer cells. Exposure to x-rays damages cells. Unlike normal cells, cancer cells cannot repair the damage caused by exposure to x-rays over several days. This prevents the cancer cells from growing further and causes them to eventually die. For patients with endometrial cancer, adjuvant radiation is given to decrease the risk of the cancer coming back in the pelvis (this is called locoregional recurrence)."
854#9#Pancreatic cancer ,"Because tumors in the body or tail of the pancreas do not cause the same symptoms as those in the head of the pancreas, these cancers tend to be discovered at a later stage, when they are more advanced.If the tumor can be removed with surgery, a laparoscopy is usually done first to make sure the cancer has not spread. If surgery is an option, part of the pancreas is removed, usually along with the spleen."
1212#7#Celiac disease in children ,"Children with celiac disease are at risk for weakened bones caused in part by poor absorption of vitamin D and calcium. Treatment of celiac disease by eating a gluten-free diet can resolve the problem in most cases. Sometimes, vitamin D and calcium supplements are also recommended. (See  ""Patient education: Vitamin D deficiency (Beyond the Basics)"".)"
3439#10#Heart transplantation ,"Approximately 85 to 90 percent of heart transplant patients are living one year after their surgery, with an annual death rate of approximately 4 percent thereafter. The three-year survival approaches 75 percent. (See  ""Heart transplantation in adults: Prognosis"".)The outcome of patients undergoing heart transplantation for complex congenital (from birth) heart disease is similar to that of patients with other forms of heart disease. The one-year survival rate in people with congenital heart disease is 79 percent; at five years, the survival rate is 60 percent."
1174#3#Kidney stones in children ,"The most common symptoms of kidney stones include:Pain in the belly or back (figure 2)Blood in the urine (hematuria)Nausea or vomitingNeeding to rush to the bathroom to urinateHowever, some children, particularly young children, do not have any symptoms, and the kidney stone is found when an imaging test (like an X-ray or ultrasound) is done for another reason.Some kidney stone symptoms are similar to those of a bladder infection (also called a urinary tract infection [UTI]). Your child's doctor or nurse will need to perform an exam and do some testing to know what is causing the symptoms. (See  ""Patient education: Urinary tract infections in children (Beyond the Basics)"".)"
1746#8#Diabetic neuropathy ,"The American Diabetes Association recommends lifestyle interventions, specifically diet and exercise, as the first line in treating diabetic neuropathy in type 2 diabetes [2]. The goal is to achieve and maintain a normal body weight with a nutrient-dense diet low in saturated fats and high in whole grains, vegetables, fruits, and lean meats. Exercise should consist of at least 150 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, such as brisk walking, at least three times per week. Muscle-strengthening activities that involve all major muscle groups are recommended two or more days per week. Sedentary activities (eg, sitting at a desk) should be interrupted every 30 minutes by brief periods of standing, walking, or other physical activities [3]."
4868#4#Depression in adults ,"Aside from major depression, discussed above, there are other forms of depression, which are characterized by their most prominent symptoms (see 'Diagnostic criteria' above). Examples include:Depression with mixed features – This is the term for depression that is accompanied by some manic symptoms, but not enough to diagnose a person with bipolar disorder. A person with this type of illness might do things like talk much more than usual, have extra energy, sleep less, or have episodes of seeming unusually happy or excited.Anxious depression – The most prominent symptoms of anxious depression include worrying, pacing, and other manifestations of anxiety.Situation-specific forms of depression – For example, women sometimes develop depression just before or just after giving birth, called “peripartum onset,” or cyclically, just before menstruating, called “premenstrual dysphoric disorder” (see  ""Patient education: Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) (Beyond the Basics)"").Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) – This is a form of depression that comes and goes during certain times of the year. The most common form of SAD starts in late fall and goes away in the spring and summer, only to return the next fall.Treatment for the different forms of depression can vary depending on the person’s symptoms and situation."
2013#2#Hemorrhoids ,"Hemorrhoids are more common in people who are older and in those who have diarrhea or pelvic tumors, during or after pregnancy, and in people who sit for prolonged periods of time and/or strain (push hard) to have a bowel movement.Symptoms of hemorrhoids can include the following:Painless rectal bleedingAnal itching or painTissue bulging around the anusLeakage of feces or difficulty cleaning after a bowel movement"
7628#4#Scabies ,"The primary symptom of scabies is widespread itching, which may be severe and is usually worse at night.Scabies also causes visible lesions (reddish bumps or blisters) on the skin; however, these are often very small and can be difficult to see (picture 1). These bumps or blisters are often more noticeable in children, especially if they scratch frequently.A person may also notice a ""burrow"" or tunnel sign, a thin, visible line in the skin that extends from 2 to 15 millimeters (0.08 to 0.6 inches). Although not everyone with scabies has visible burrows, the presence of such marks strongly suggests scabies. (See 'Do I have scabies?' below.)The following parts of the body are more likely than others to be affected by scabies (figure 1):The fingers and webbing between the fingersThe skin folds around the wrists, elbows, and kneesThe armpitsThe area surrounding the nipples (particularly in women)The waistThe male genitalia (penis and scrotum)The lower buttocks and upper thighsThe sides and bottoms of the feetThe back is usually not affected, nor is the head (except sometimes in infants or very young children).Scabies lesions can become more irritated and inflamed with scratching, which may lead to infection. (See 'Treating infection' below.)"
735#17#Seizures in adults ,"Women taking antiseizure medications who might become pregnant should talk to their doctor about their plans for pregnancy.Antiseizure medications can affect the health of a developing fetus, and they can interfere with the effects of certain birth control methods, so this discussion is important for women regardless of whether or not you want to get pregnant. (See  ""Patient education: Birth control; which method is right for me? (Beyond the Basics)"" and  ""Management of epilepsy during preconception, pregnancy, and the postpartum period"" and  ""Risks associated with epilepsy during pregnancy and postpartum period"".)"
1213#19#Bronchiolitis and RSV in infants and children ,"There are several ways to prevent severe bronchiolitis:Avoid smoking around the child, as this increases the risk of respiratory illness.Wash hands frequently with soap and water, especially before touching an infant. Hands should ideally be wet with water and plain or antimicrobial soap, and rubbed together for at least 20 seconds. Hands should be rinsed thoroughly and dried with a single-use towel. If you cannot wash your hands in a sink, use a gel with at least 60 percent alcohol.Stay away from other adults and children with upper respiratory infection. Keep infants or children home from school or day care when they are sick.A yearly vaccination for influenza virus is recommended for everyone older than six months, especially for household contacts of children younger than five years, and out-of-home caregivers of children younger than five years. (See  ""Patient education: Influenza symptoms and treatment (Beyond the Basics)"".)For adults and older children who are eligible, getting the COVID-19 vaccine will help to protect children in the home (or child care setting) who are not yet vaccinated.Infants who are younger than 24 months with specific types of chronic lung disease and infants who are younger than 12 months who were born before 29 weeks, have specific types of heart disease, or have other risk factors for severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection may be given a special medication (palivizumab) to prevent severe RSV infection requiring hospitalization. Palivizumab (brand name: Synagis) is a monoclonal antibody that protects the lungs from severe infection from RSV. It is given as an injection into the muscle once per month for five months. There is a low risk of serious side effects with palivizumab."
699#9#Paget disease of bone (osteitis deformans) ,"The breakdown and buildup of bone is essential in regulating the levels of calcium and phosphorus in the blood. In most people with Paget disease, these levels remain normal. (See  ""Patient education: Primary hyperparathyroidism (Beyond the Basics)"".)"
7626#8#Skin burns ,"Remove any clothing from the burned area. If clothing is stuck to the skin, do not try to remove it, and seek emergency medical care. You can wash the burned skin gently with cool tap water and plain soap. It is not necessary to disinfect the skin with alcohol, iodine, or other cleansers. In fact, these substances can be irritating and painful."
7629#3#Bedbugs ,"Bedbugs are small and wingless (nonflying), with flat, oval-shaped bodies and six legs (picture 1). They are reddish-brown in color, and may appear redder after feeding on blood. Adult bedbugs reach about 0.25 inches (5 to 7 mm) in length, and the body elongates and widens after a meal.As bedbugs molt (shed their skin) several times throughout their lifetime, cast-off skins may occasionally be visible at the site of a previous or current infestation."
682#8#Blood donation and transfusion ,"Donating blood removes iron from the body, and this can result in iron deficiency if iron stores are already low. The risk of iron deficiency is highest in teenage donors; premenopausal women, especially if they have been pregnant; and individuals who donate frequently (such as men of any age and women over 50 who donate three or more times per year, or women under age 50 who donate two or more times per year). Because the strategy of eating iron-rich foods is not sufficient to replenish lost iron, many blood organizations recommend that people at increased risk for iron deficiency take a multivitamin with iron or an iron-only supplement for approximately 60 days to replace the iron lost through each blood donation."
863#19#Testicular cancer ,"In general, seminomas grow slowly and do not spread rapidly to other areas of the body. Surgery (radical inguinal orchiectomy) is recommended for all men with early stage seminoma. Following surgery, three treatment options are possible, all of which have an excellent cure rate (98 percent). Treatment options include surveillance (watchful waiting), RT, and chemotherapy.RPLND is used in some situations after chemotherapy, but it is not usually performed initially (see 'Lymph node removal' above). A single dose of RT or a chemotherapy called carboplatin is sometimes used to treat patients with stage I seminoma who are not candidates for active surveillance.Not all treatments are suitable for all patients; your doctors will work with you to determine the most appropriate option based on your situation."
7631#9#Alopecia areata ,"Topical corticosteroids are sometimes prescribed as an alternative to injected corticosteroids for children or adults who cannot tolerate injections. Topical corticosteroids are usually applied to affected areas on a daily basis. Like injected corticosteroids, this treatment is used for patients with isolated patches of hair loss. Topical corticosteroids may not be as beneficial for people with extensive hair loss."
1200#6#Chronic abdominal pain in children and adolescents ,"Abdominal migraines cause similar episodes of intense abdominal pain, centered in the mid-abdomen, lasting one hour or more. Between episodes the child is completely well for weeks to months. The child might also have loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, headache, or sensitivity to light. Many, but not all, children with abdominal migraine have a family history of migraine. (See  ""Patient education: Headache in children (Beyond the Basics)"".)"
1184#4#High blood pressure treatment in children ,"The first step in the treatment of hypertension is to treat any underlying cause for hypertension (secondary hypertension), if present.If treating the underlying cause does not adequately reduce blood pressure, or if there is no known underlying cause (primary, formerly called ""essential"", hypertension), treatments to reduce the blood pressure are recommended. (See  ""Patient education: High blood pressure in children (Beyond the Basics)"", section on 'Types of high blood pressure'.)Treatment includes lifestyle changes (diet changes, regular exercise, and if appropriate, weight loss) and/or medications."
6726#4#Preterm labor ,Conditions like placenta previa (when the placenta partially or completely covers the cervix) and placental abruption (when the placenta separates from the uterus before delivery) cause vaginal bleeding and can trigger preterm labor.
2186#18#Gynecomastia (breast enlargement in men) ,"Gynecomastia in adolescent boys is usually caused by puberty-related hormonal changes. Pubertal gynecomastia usually resolves on its own, but the condition persists into adulthood in up to 20 percent of individuals. In extreme or painful cases, a brief course of tamoxifen might be recommended.Gynecomastia in adult men may be caused by an underlying health problem or by the use of a drug. In such cases, treating the underlying condition or stopping the drug usually allows gynecomastia to resolve. When the cause of gynecomastia cannot be identified, brief use of tamoxifen may be recommended.Men who have had gynecomastia for more than one year do not typically benefit from the use of tamoxifen. For them, surgery to reduce the size of the breasts is an option.Men with prostate cancer who undergo antiandrogen therapy are at risk for developing gynecomastia. Pretreatment with radiation or taking a medication (tamoxifen) along with the antiandrogen are two options for preventing breast growth."
4650#5#Thoracentesis ,"In most cases, a thoracentesis is performed without complications. When complications do occur, they are usually minor and resolve on their own or are easily treated. Potential complications include the following:Pain – There may be some discomfort when the needle is inserted. Using a local anesthetic helps to reduce the pain. Pain generally resolves once the needle is removed.Feeling faint – Some people may feel faint or dizzy during or after the procedure. This feeling generally resolves after lying down for a few minutes. Bleeding – A blood vessel may be punctured when the needle is inserted through the skin and chest wall, causing bleeding. The bleeding is usually minor and stops on its own, although it may cause bruising around the puncture site. In rare cases, there may be bleeding into or around the lung, requiring drainage of blood collected in the chest by insertion of a catheter or surgery.Infection – Infection can develop if bacteria are introduced by the needle puncture. Using disinfectant solution to clean the area and using sterile technique during the procedure minimize this risk making infection a very rare complication.Pneumothorax or collapsed lung – Occasionally, the needle used to obtain a fluid sample can puncture the lung. The hole created by the puncture usually seals quickly on its own. If it does not, air can build up around the lung, causing the lung to collapse. This is called a pneumothorax. When a pneumothorax occurs, a chest tube may be used to drain the air from the pleural space and allow the lung to re-expand. A pneumothorax happens in approximately 6 percent of thoracentesis procedures, but in less than 3 percent of procedures when the thoracentesis is performed with the assistance of ultrasound imaging. Pneumothoraces that do occur are usually small and resolve on their own. About a third of pneumothoraces become large, continue to expand, or cause shortness of breath. In these patients, a catheter or chest tube is placed through the skin into the pleural space to withdraw the air. Liver or spleen puncture – In very rare cases, the liver or spleen may be punctured during thoracentesis. Sitting upright and remaining still during the procedure helps to keep the liver and spleen away from the insertion area and minimizes the risk of this complication. Ultrasound imaging to guide placement of the thoracentesis needle also decreases the risk of these complications.Pulmonary edema – Rarely after thoracentesis, a person can experience pulmonary edema, which is the sudden collection of fluid within the lung on the side of the chest where the thoracentesis was performed. Some people may experience shortness of breath or cough, but usually recover quickly. Pulmonary edema tends to occur when a large volume of pleural fluid is removed during a therapeutic thoracentesis. "
2726#6#Urinary incontinence treatments for women ,"Bladder training can help you learn to go to the bathroom less frequently by ""retraining"" your bladder to hold more urine. Bladder training has two components: going to the bathroom on a schedule while you are awake and using strategies to control sudden urges. A table describes a method for bladder training (table 2).You begin by going to the bathroom at specific intervals during the day, starting with a short time interval between trips to the bathroom.If you have an urgent need to urinate before it is time to go the bathroom again, try to suppress the urge by standing or sitting still, performing the pelvic muscle exercise described above (“freeze and squeeze""), and thinking of the urge as a wave that is fading away.When your urine control improves, increase the time between bathroom trips by 15 minutes. Your goal is to slowly increase this time up to a more normal interval. It is normal to urinate approximately every three to four hours during the day and for older adults to wake from sleeping to urinate up to once per night."
8399#5#Vaginal dryness ,"Vaginal estrogen is one of the most effective treatment options for vaginal dryness. Vaginal estrogen requires a prescription from your health care provider, so ask about this if lubricants and moisturizers are not doing enough to relieve your symptoms. (See 'Vaginal lubricants and moisturizers' above.)Some women worry about possible side effects from hormones. Very low doses of estrogen can be used to treat vaginal dryness when it is in the form of a vaginal cream or insertable tablet, capsule, or ring. A small amount of estrogen is absorbed into the bloodstream with these vaginal forms, but when used regularly, the level of estrogen in the blood is in the same range as in postmenopausal women who are not using vaginal estrogen. As a result, there is a much lower risk of the side effects people sometimes worry about, such as blood clots, breast cancer, and heart attack, compared with other estrogen-containing products (eg, birth control pills, menopausal hormone therapy).Several types of vaginal estrogen products are available:Cream – Estrogen cream is measured with an applicator and inserted into the vagina (if inserting the applicator is uncomfortable, you can also use your finger). The cream is usually inserted every day for two weeks and then one or two times weekly after that. With some doses, you may also need to a take another hormonal medication, called a progestin. This is to prevent the lining of your uterus from building up and becoming precancerous or cancerous. Ask your health care provider whether you need to take a progestin with the vaginal estrogen cream you are using.Tablet or capsule – The vaginal estrogen insert is a small tablet or capsule that you put in your vagina. It comes packaged in a disposable applicator. It is usually inserted every day for two weeks and then twice weekly after that. Some women find it uncomfortable to insert the applicator at first, when vaginal dryness is at its worst; if you have this problem, ask your health care provider if you should use another form of vaginal estrogen. Ring – The vaginal estrogen ring (brand name: Estring) is a flexible plastic ring you wear inside your vagina all the time. You replace it with a new ring every three months. The ring does not need to be removed during sex or bathing. It cannot be felt by most women or their sexual partners. In women who have previously had a hysterectomy, the ring will sometimes fall out.The estrogen ring used to treat vaginal dryness should not be confused with a different estrogen replacement vaginal ring (brand name: Femring), which releases a much higher dose of estrogen. The estrogen in the higher dose ring is intended to be absorbed into the body to relieve hot flashes in women going through menopause. (See  ""Patient education: Menopausal hormone therapy (Beyond the Basics)"".)"
7962#3#High altitude illness (including mountain sickness) ,"If you will be sleeping above 8000 feet (2400 m) and have concerns about developing altitude sickness because of prior episodes or other risk factors, you should make an appointment with a knowledgeable healthcare provider. During this visit, you should discuss your travel plans, availability of medical care at your destination, and the potential need for medicines to prevent and/or treat high altitude illness. Methods for reducing risk and treating altitude sickness are discussed in greater detail below. (See 'AMS prevention' below and 'AMS treatment' below.)"
7627#21#Psoriasis ,"Tar is a substance distilled from coal that has been used to treat psoriasis for many years. It is not completely clear how tar works, although it appears to inhibit the inflammation that leads to psoriasis. Tar preparations are available in shampoos, creams, oils, and lotions without a prescription, and are usually applied to the skin or scalp once or twice a day. Tar products do not cause skin thinning but can have an unpleasant odor and can stain skin, hair, and clothing. Tar products are often used along with corticosteroids or with ultraviolet light treatments. (See 'Ultraviolet light' below.)"
2168#2#Antithyroid drugs ,"Antithyroid drugs decrease the levels of the two hormones produced by the thyroid, thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). (See  ""Patient education: Hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid) (Beyond the Basics)"".)Antithyroid drugs may be used:As a short-term treatment in people with Graves' hyperthyroidism, to prepare for thyroid surgery or radioiodine.As initial treatment in Graves' disease for one to two years to see if the disease resolves. Approximately 30 percent of people with Graves' disease will have a remission after treatment for one to two years with antithyroid drugs. (See  ""Thionamides in the treatment of Graves' disease"".)To treat hyperthyroidism associated with toxic multinodular goiter or a toxic adenoma (""hot nodule""), usually to prepare for thyroid surgery or radioiodine. (See  ""Patient education: Thyroid nodules (Beyond the Basics)"".)To treat women with hyperthyroidism during pregnancy.For long-term treatment of hyperthyroidism due to Graves' disease or toxic multinodular goiter or toxic adenoma when patients prefer to avoid definitive therapy with radioiodine or surgery.You will need to take antithyroid drugs for at least three weeks (usually six to eight weeks or longer) to lower thyroid hormone levels. This is because they only block formation of new thyroid hormone; they do not remove thyroid hormones that are already in the thyroid and the blood stream. If you frequently miss taking the antithyroid drug, thyroid hormone synthesis may resume quickly and replenish thyroid gland stores, prolonging or preventing adequate control of the hyperthyroidism."
884#14#Breast cancer screening ,"A breast ultrasound is also not recommended as a routine screening test for people at average risk for breast cancer. Studies have shown that people who are screened with both mammograms and ultrasound tests are more likely to be referred for unnecessary breast biopsies, and so the benefit of adding ultrasound to mammography is not clear.People with dense breasts (a term used to describe the appearance of the breast tissue on imaging) are at a slightly increased risk of breast cancer. If a mammogram shows that your breasts are very dense, this may make it more difficult for the radiologist to interpret a screening mammogram. In this situation, an ultrasound may be suggested in addition to mammography. However, there are no available studies showing that ultrasound screening for people with dense breast tissue will actually reduce the risk of dying of breast cancer."
1987#2#Weight loss surgery and procedures ,"Weight loss surgery is recommended ONLY for people with one of the following (table 1):Severe obesity (body mass index [BMI] above 40). BMI above 35 with a serious medical problem related to obesity (including diabetes, severe joint pain, sleep apnea, and many others) that would improve with weight loss. BMI above 30 with specific conditions, including a certain type of diabetes or a combination of diseases like high blood pressure, sleep apnea, high cholesterol, and diabetes (also known as ""metabolic syndrome""). Certain races, such as Southeastern Asians and Indians, have more truncal obesity and will experience the effects of obesity at lower BMIs; consequently, these patients may be eligible for consideration of surgery at a lower BMI of 27.5 kg/m2. This may apply to patients who have immigrated to the United States but may not apply to their future generations [1]. Different surgeons, weight loss programs, and insurance companies have different requirements around making healthy lifestyle changes (ie, improving sleep, nutrition, and activity habits) before offering surgery. Occasionally, a person may have enough success losing weight through these lifestyle changes that he or she decides not to go through with a bariatric procedure. In other cases, a person may manage to reduce his or her BMI to the point where it falls below the required minimum for surgery. Many surgeons will still proceed with weight loss surgery in these situations since the person met the requirements when he or she started the program. Since obesity is considered a chronic disease, the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery supports proceeding with surgery in these situations because of the high likelihood that the weight will return. However, it's important to talk to your surgeon about his or her policies and requirements. Insurance coverage for weight loss surgery also varies by carrier and policy, so be sure you understand your benefits and options.You should also be sure that you understand the potential risks and benefits of weight loss surgery. You must be motivated and willing to make lifelong changes in how you eat and live to reach and maintain a healthier weight after surgery. You must also be realistic about the amount of weight loss you can expect after surgery. (See 'Effectiveness of surgery for weight loss' below.) "
510#1#Rheumatoid arthritis and pregnancy ,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) affects 1 percent of the adults in the United States, with more women affected than men. Many women with RA are of childbearing age, which highlights the importance of careful family planning especially in patients who are taking medications or who have active disease.In many women with RA, disease activity improves substantially during pregnancy. However, some women's RA flares up or stays active during pregnancy. Thus, it is often necessary to change or modify treatment of RA during pregnancy to control flares while minimizing the risks of RA treatments to the developing fetus.A number of other topics about RA are available separately. (See  ""Patient education: Rheumatoid arthritis symptoms and diagnosis (Beyond the Basics)"" and  ""Patient education: Rheumatoid arthritis treatment (Beyond the Basics)"" and  ""Patient education: Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) in rheumatoid arthritis (Beyond the Basics)"".)"
4426#17#Peritoneal dialysis ,"Hernia is the medical term for a weakness in the abdominal muscle. People who use peritoneal dialysis are at risk of developing a hernia for several reasons, including the increased stress on the muscles of the abdomen (as a result of the weight of the dialysate) and the opening in the abdominal muscle created by the peritoneal dialysis catheter. Hernias can develop near the belly button (umbilical hernia), in the groin (inguinal hernia), or near the catheter site (incisional hernia).Signs of a hernia include painless swelling or new lump in the groin or abdomen. If you develop signs of a hernia, contact your health care provider but continue to perform peritoneal dialysis regularly. Treatment of a hernia generally involves surgery. (See  ""Abdominal hernias in continuous peritoneal dialysis"".)"
3438#5#Raynaud phenomenon ,"The normal control of blood vessel responses to cold and other stimuli is complex, involving the central nervous system, peripheral sensory nerves, and molecules released by circulating cells or from the inner lining of the blood vessel itself (called the endothelium). Raynaud phenomenon (RP) occurs when this complex and delicate system of control is disrupted, which alters the normal responses to the environment.A Raynaud attack can be triggered by exposure to cold temperature or even by a shift in temperature from warm to cool. As a result, even mildly cold exposures, such as those caused by air conditioning or the cold of the refrigerated food section in a grocery store, can cause an attack. Experiencing a general body chill can trigger an attack, even if the hands and feet are kept warm. Feeling emotional stress and being startled can cause an attack of RP due to the release of nerve transmitter substances; these substances activate certain proteins in the blood vessels, which signal the vessels to narrow (constrict)."
3443#23#Medications for angina ,"Beta blockers are more effective than calcium channel blockers for reducing the frequency of angina, but they are similar in terms of improving exercise tolerance and decreasing the need for nitroglycerin. However, people taking calcium channel blockers, especially nifedipine, are much more likely to stop taking the medication because of side effects."
3693#8#Initial treatment of HIV ,Immediate initiation of ART is often recommended for people with certain underlying medical conditions. This includes the following conditions:HIV-associated nephropathy (kidney disease caused by HIV)HIV-associated changes in brain functioningHepatitis B or hepatitis CHIV-related cancersCertain HIV-related infections that are likely to resolve more quickly with ART
7627#30#Psoriasis ,"Several medications that suppress the immune system can be used to treat severe psoriasis for a short period of time. These include cyclosporine, hydroxyurea, and azathioprine. "
7627#11#Psoriasis ,"Some people with psoriasis develop nail problems, including tiny pits over the surface of the nails. The pits look as if someone has taken a pin and pricked the nail several times (picture 7). In addition, nails may develop a tan-brown color (also known as ""oil spots"") or may separate from the nail bed (also known as ""onycholysis"") (picture 8 and picture 9). In more severe cases, people have thick, crumbling nails.Treatment of nail psoriasis is difficult and may include injections of steroids into the nail bed or internal medications, such as methotrexate or other immunomodulatory drugs. (See 'Psoriasis treatment' below.)"
3445#7#Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy ,"An echocardiogram uses ultrasound (high-frequency sound waves) to measure the muscle thickness of the left ventricle and motion of the ventricular walls, the size of the heart's chambers, the function of the heart valves (including the mitral valve), and flow of blood within the heart. Blood flow measurements help to identify left ventricular outflow tract obstruction and determine the magnitude of extra pressure in the heart generated by this obstruction, as well as the presence and severity of mitral regurgitation.Some patients may develop obstruction to blood flow only with exertion, and therefore echocardiography may also be performed during or immediately after exercise in order to detect this issue.Testing family members with an echocardiogram and ECG is recommended in many situations."
1182#13#Autism spectrum disorder ,"Cognitive skills include the ability to think, remember, and process information. In children with ASD, these skills are often uneven, regardless of the child's level of intelligence. The person can often perform tasks that require memorization or putting things together (eg, puzzles), but may have difficulty with tasks that require other skills, such as reasoning, interpretation, or abstract thinking.Some individuals have special skills or strengths (sometimes called ""savant"" skills) in memory, mathematics, music, art, or puzzles, despite significant difficulties in other areas. Other special skills can include calendar calculation (determining the day of the week for a given date) and hyperlexia (the ability to read written words that are far above the person's reading level). However, the person may not understand what is being read or the purpose of reading."
2003#11#Constipation in adults ,Saline laxatives such as magnesium hydroxide (Milk of Magnesia) and magnesium citrate (Evac-Q-Mag) act similarly to the hyperosmolar laxatives.
7632#5#Poison ivy ,The rash caused by poison ivy is usually diagnosed based upon how the skin looks. Further testing is not usually necessary. A study revealed that visiting an emergency department for poison ivy dermatitis costs three times more than going to an urgent care clinic or doctor's office.
6724#14#Miscarriage ,"People experience a range of emotions following miscarriage; there is no right or wrong way to feel. The loss of a pregnancy can cause significant grief. Sometimes these reactions are strong and long-lasting. You should let your health care provider know if you are feeling profound sadness or depression following pregnancy loss, especially if it continues for greater than several weeks. Referral for grief counseling or other treatment may be helpful. (See  ""Patient education: Depression in adults (Beyond the Basics)"".)"
689#8#Warfarin ,"If there are obvious or subtle signs of bleeding, including the following, you should call your healthcare provider immediately.Persistent nausea, stomach upset, or vomiting blood or other material that looks like coffee groundsHeadaches, dizziness, or weaknessNosebleedsDark red or brown urineBlood in the bowel movement or dark-colored stoolA serious fall or head injury, even if there are no other symptomsA car accident or other serious injury that could cause bleedingIt is also important to notify your healthcare provider if you have any of the following:Bleeding from the gums after brushing the teethSwelling or pain at an injection siteBlack and blue skin (bruising)Excessive menstrual bleeding or bleeding between menstrual periodsDiarrhea, vomiting, or inability to eat for more than 24 hoursFever (temperature greater than 100.4°F or 38°C), which could be a sign of infection that might alter the INRA new medication prescribed by another clinician, because some medications can alter the INR in people taking warfarinA planned surgery or procedure, because it may be necessary to stop the warfarin for a period of time to decrease your risk of bleeding during or after the procedureIt is important to remember that warfarin is taken to reduce the risk of a clotting condition(s), such as a deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), or stroke. If you develop any symptoms of a clot, seek immediate medical attention. (See  ""Patient education: Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (Beyond the Basics)"" and  ""Patient education: Pulmonary embolism (Beyond the Basics)"" and  ""Patient education: Stroke symptoms and diagnosis (Beyond the Basics)"".)"
3435#12#Cardioversion ,"There are several complications that can occur with cardioversion:An important risk of the cardioversion procedure is the sedation itself. Moderate or deep sedation, which is used to allow the cardioversion procedure to be done without the patient feeling pain, can result in aspiration of stomach contents causing pneumonia, or obstruction of breathing. The risk of problems associated with sedation is higher in patients who are obese, have sleep apnea, or have an abnormal airway. In many facilities sedation for scheduled cardioversions is administered by an anesthesiologist, either routinely or in high-risk patients.Cardioversion can sometimes provoke other fast or slow arrhythmias. The shock is timed with the heartbeat to avoid provoking a dangerous arrhythmia. In an occasional patient, the sinus node may not work properly after cardioversion and a very slow heart rate may result. A temporary pacemaker may be necessary to correct this problem.Cardioversion can result in a stroke. A stroke can occur when the shock either causes a clot that is already present to travel to the brain or elsewhere throughout the body, or results in formation of a new clot after the cardioversion; this is less likely in patients who have had an arrhythmia for less than 24 to 48 hours. Use of a blood thinner (anticoagulant) before cardioversion greatly reduces this risk. (See 'Atrial fibrillation' above.)Some heart tissue may be damaged as a result of high-energy shocks or repeated shocks. Significant damage is uncommon and there are generally no short or long term complications.The skin may be burned and/or painful as a result of the shocks. Taking a medication, such as ibuprofen, can reduce the severity of this pain."
2166#21#Acromegaly ,"People who have acromegaly may produce inadequate amounts of other pituitary hormones because of compression of the normal pituitary by the adenoma or as a complication of surgery or radiation therapy. Levels of hormones produced by the thyroid gland, adrenal glands, and ovaries or testes should be monitored and replaced as needed."
3421#21#Syncope (fainting) ,This test is often done in healthy people who have syncope but can be used in any age group. You lie on a flat table and are tilted upward to predetermined (usually 70 degrees) angles while your heart rate and blood pressure are monitored closely (figure 5). Your response to the change in position can sometimes give clues about the cause of syncope.
863#32#Testicular cancer ,"Men with stage I, good-prognosis disease have an excellent chance for cure when treated appropriately (see 'Testicular cancer staging and classification' above). Men who have an intermediate or poor prognosis also generally respond well to treatment and require a more aggressive treatment regimen. Even for those with a poor prognosis, approximately one-half can be cured."
881#14#Surgical procedures for breast cancer — Mastectomy and breast-conserving therapy ,"During a modified radical mastectomy (MRM), the breast tissue and the lymph nodes in the armpit (the axillary lymph nodes) are removed. An axillary node dissection is necessary only if the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes. (See 'Management of axillary lymph nodes' below.)"
4870#1#Depression treatment options for children and adolescents ,"If you are the parent of a child or adolescent (teen) who has been diagnosed with clinical depression, you may be worried about your child and the implications of treatment. When people talk about depression, they’re usually referring to what healthcare providers call unipolar major depression (or major depressive disorder). You may have heard stories in the media of self-harm, risk-taking, and substance abuse among young people who are depressed. You may have also heard alarming warnings about the potential risks of antidepressants. However, depression in children and adolescents can be safely and effectively treated. Psychological treatments (psychotherapy), medication therapy (pharmacotherapy), and other measures can alleviate symptoms and help children and adolescents to succeed in school, develop and maintain healthy relationships, and feel more self-confident. Although it is not clear that antidepressants cause suicide in children and adolescents, it is clear that depression can cause suicide. This topic review discusses the treatment options available for children and adolescents with depression. The causes, symptoms, and diagnosis of depression are discussed separately (see  ""Patient education: Depression in children and adolescents (Beyond the Basics)""). Parents who are unsure if their child is depressed should discuss their uncertainty with their doctor and read the topic review on diagnosis before they read the present topic on treatment.Topic reviews about depression in adults are also available. (See  ""Patient education: Depression in adults (Beyond the Basics)"" and  ""Patient education: Depression treatment options for adults (Beyond the Basics)"".)"
376#2#Exercise-induced asthma ,"Typical symptoms are shortness of breath, chest tightness, and cough. Exercise-triggered symptoms typically develop 10 to 15 minutes after a brief episode of exercise or about 15 minutes into prolonged exercise. Symptoms typically resolve with rest over 30 to 60 minutes. Exercise-induced symptoms occur more commonly and are more intense when the inhaled air is cold, probably due to changes in the airways that are triggered by the large amounts of relatively cool, dry air inhaled during vigorous activity. (See  ""Patient education: Trigger avoidance in asthma (Beyond the Basics)"".)EIB is different than simple shortness of breath related to exercise, which generally resolves within five minutes of stopping exercise."
3424#1#Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome ,"Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome is a condition in which episodes of fast heart rate (called tachycardia) occur because of an abnormal extra electrical pathway in the heart. People with WPW may experience palpitations, dizziness, lightheadedness, and fainting, although some people with WPW have no symptoms. Treatments are available for those who do experience symptoms. The long-term outcome of people with WPW is excellent, especially when treatments are used to eliminate the abnormal conduction pathway.This topic review discusses how the heart functions in people with WPW, the signs and symptoms of the condition, how it is diagnosed, and the available treatments."
